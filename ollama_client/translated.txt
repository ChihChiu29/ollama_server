Love Hate Story: The CEO Please Stay Away Roll Away
View Details
One. For a Waistline, I Work Hard
I sat on the edge of my bed and calmly lit a cigarette: "Don't be sad, I'll take care of you."
The man pulled up the covers, revealing his cold and harsh facial expression and angular jawline. His thin lips twitched into a mischievous smile, and he extended his long finger to lift my chin: "Woman, are you trying to attract my attention like that? Hmm?"
I didn't move or speak, just subtly moving his hand away: "Ah, no, not at all..."
God knows how much I've strained my brain to keep this man from hating me, just so he'll throw me out of Africa.
I never thought I'd become the heroine of my own novel, The CEO Finally Regrets It - a saintly and virtuous protagonist. In this new world, I can only rely on my precognitive abilities about the plot to survive.
In half a month, the male lead Zhao Ling Hao's white moonlight Qin Zidian will return, and if I'm not mistaken, he'll come back on the second day after his return, digging up the female protagonist - that is me, Qin Yurui's kidney. The cold shoulder male two, Bi Luan, will sneakily take me away after I just had surgery.
Right now, my most important goal is to keep my kidney intact.
Suddenly, a brilliant idea struck me - if Bi Luan has the ability to carry me, why not go now?
But now, I don't know where to find him, and my stomach is twisted into knots. Why didn't I just give him a fake address?! Looks like we'll have to rely on luck now.
As I was immersed in worries, I suddenly thought of it - today, the famous actress Lin Yu xue wants to come, and memory told me she's intentionally coming to provoke me, intentionally falling from the stairs and accusing me.
According to my current situation, I can only hide. But this is Zhao Ling Hao's territory, no matter where I hide, he'll always find me.
Thinking it over, I decide to stay in the bathroom.
Looking at the time, Lin Yu xue should be here soon, so I carefully listen behind the bathroom door. There are indeed people outside.
"Zhao Ling Hao, someone is calling your name. By the way, have you seen Rain Yurui? Why isn't she around?"
Hearing her mention me, I instinctively took a step back, but then I kicked over a bottle of Mafenglan, and I was startled awake, deciding to start by attacking first: "Lin Yu xue, I'm in the bathroom right now!"
Zhao Ling Hao's tone is impatient: "Rain Yurui, why are you still in there for another hour?!"
"I, I have constipation."
I wasted another 20 minutes, and it was totally pointless. I could only open the door to come out.
Lin Yu xue pretended to care about me, eyeing Zhao Ling Hao who is still expressionless:
"I'm just feeling a little uncomfortable, that's all."
Zhao Ling Hao sneered: "Where did you get constipation from?"
My face turned red, and Lin Yu xue's face went white. I've never felt as regretful about giving the toxic personality trait to a protagonist before.
Lin Yu xue pretended to be calm, taking my hand and saying she wanted to go to my room to take a look.Started, she started!
I shook my head like a sea drum's: "Don't don't don't, let's just chat on the first floor, there's no need to go to my room."
But she wouldn't budge and Zhao Lin Hao insisted on going, saying look at me again.
I was sweating bullets, thinking clearly: "Then let's go, just as long as you're not disgusted with the naked male posters plastered all over my room. I'll tell you, they're all extreme, every night I'd be staring at the walls of muscles and chests falling asleep."
Zhao Lin Hao glared at me with an intense gaze that was even more lethal than Superman's laser beams.
To maintain his innocent image as a pure girl, Lin Yu Liu finally gave up visiting the second floor. I breathed a sigh of relief, managing to avoid a disaster.
I spent time dodging and fighting off other girls who were also trying to mess with Zhao Lin Hao, but finally, the White Lotus King Qin Zhi Huan returned."
I was listless and not very hungry, only eating two bowls of dinner, and Zhao Lin Hao asked me: "What's wrong?"
"I'm sick."]
After dinner, I fell asleep early, but after trying to turn over, I realized a truth: people need to take care of themselves.
Perhaps I overthought things too much last night, I woke up just before noon, and Zhao Lin Hao left for work, with all his employees being Zhao Lin Hao's eyes. I casually came to the villa door, pulled out the key from the previous night, and started testing it, one by one."
I was about to open the door when I realized it was a password lock! Ah ha! I am the author, who knows the password better than anyone!
I pressed 123456 down.
Drip drip, the door opened. 
The first thing I did after getting out was going to the market, thinking about how people and pigs are both mammals, so human waistlines and pig waistlines should be similar. So I decided to buy a pig's waistline right away."
I walked with the pig's waistline to the hospital, finding the surgeon who wanted to remove my kidneys.
He smiled: "Our doctor doesn't accept patients' gifts."
"Is that right? Have you ever seen anyone giving gifts at the hospital?" I whispered close to him, "Tomorrow night, I'll bring another girl in. She claims she needs a kidney transplant, but actually, she's healthy and doesn't have any problems. The goal is just to steal my kidney, so I want to ask you not to really take out my kidneys and instead give the pig's kidney to someone who looks like me. After that, I'll go back home, add some scallions, and cook it, which will be particularly delicious!"
He took the pig's waistline, nodding slightly, and then picked up the phone and made a call, whispering something in a low voice.
After hanging up the phone, he told me not to move around, and I was quickly taken by the hospital security guard to the psychiatric ward."
"Nothing, I'm fine, you guys got it wrong!"
It was Zhao Lin Hao who came to rescue me, and I didn't want to go see him with his scrunched-up face or talk to him about his mood!
I wanted to burrow into a hole and die of shame, this is really embarrassing, I just want to hide. 
He got into his Ferrari, stepped on the brakes with 250 miles per hour, turned around and mocked me: "How was eating the pig's waistline?".
I slapped him a few times on the arm: "Get out."
When we arrived at the villa, we found several luggage boxes, which I thought was not good. Just then, a beautiful woman with piercing eyes and elegant features appeared from the balcony upstairs.

I immediately guessed that she was Qin Zhi Huan's evil second wife, Qin Zhi Huan!
She's back, or she's back again. The ruthless emperor of business is rolling over me mercilessly. Maybe I should eat more pig's waistline tonight to compensate for it....I suddenly woke up, I forgot that Zhao Lin Hao would spend a romantic night with Qin Yuwei because of his guilt towards her.
I don't want to!
He didn't wait for me to come up with a strategy, Zhao Lin Hao was already at the door and in. Right now I regret giving him the freedom to come and go as he pleased.
It was no surprise that he only put on a bathrobe, revealing his big muscles and eight blocks of abdominal muscle.
This physique is just provocative…… ah, forget it! We're not going to be cool right now, we need to calm down!
He tightly furrowed his eyebrows, with a guilty expression, taking one step forward and throwing his arms around me.
I struggled hard, he whispered in a low voice, "Woman, you're playing with fire!
I froze instantly, swallowing my saliva, "I'll splash water, let's go rescue Grandpa together."
He smiled, "You said you would what?
Oh no! I just said something fierce! Retreat, retreat!
I used all my strength to kick him on the abdominal muscle, forcing us apart: "Can't you wait a bit, slow down.
He finally released me, looking at me with a playful and teasing expression.

Looking at it this way, unless we bind him, tonight will be definitely…. Ahah, binding him would just make it worse!
I clenched my teeth and let go:
"Lin Hao, today was a bit exciting, I'll go find some rope."
He first paused, then had a smile that showed he was up to no good, "You're really something!
After I found the rope, we got into another argument about who should be bound.
This guy is soft and hard at the same time, I decided to back down: "No way, it's my turn now."
He finally backed off, I smiled wickedly binding him: "Don't you dare, he was going to find out."
"Lin Hao, today we were a bit wild, let me go get some rope."
He took one step back, with an expression that said "you're really something, you're on a roll."
We got into another argument about who should be bound.
I finally gave in: "No way, I want to take the lead."
He was finally stopped, I laughed, throwing the bed covers over him.
"Qin Yuwei, warning you!
"Who made you think of this? Colorful devil, ah, ha!
I sat on a nearby sofa, drinking Italian-made coffee, quietly watching him.
He started squirming, probably trying to untie himself.
I smiled: "You'll just get worse."
"Qin Yuwei!"
He struggled for a long time, finally giving up, and fell asleep right away. I didn't expect Zhao Lin Hao to be able to do anything exciting. I relaxed, but couldn't resist the rolling waves of sleepiness, falling asleep.
I slept all day, and Zhao Lin Hao was nowhere to be found, only leaving behind the rope.
How did he escape?I painstakingly remembered that I was about to witness another high-energy scene.
Qin Zhide once again looked at me with a completely innocent expression, smiling warmly at me: "Sister, we haven't talked for a long time."
If I wasn't mistaken, she wanted to play hardball.
I was about to retreat when she suddenly grabbed my arm, her eyes brimming with tears as she stared at me.
It's surprising that anyone would fall for her act.
At this moment, the maid Li Mama walked by carrying a bowl of fruit, saying: "Madam, Mr. CEO told you to take some time off today so you could chat with Qin Zhide."
I was about to speak up when I hesitated.
The only thing we can do now is be polite, so I sat down stiffly next to her.
" Sister, I've really missed you over the past few years," she started crying, feigning tears.
It's no surprise that this is how I wrote my character – very dramatic.
I was mentally calculating time, watching the clock tick by as the high-energy scene began.
Just then, Qin Zhide suddenly sat down on the ground, her eyes red and puffy as she stared at me: "Sister, I said something wrong, why did you push me and hit me?"
Lao Zhao was walking back to the office with files when he saw this scene unfold, and his face darkened as he rushed over to Qin Zhide's side, holding her close while glaring at me: "Qin Yavi, are you going to forgive her?"
I didn't know how to escape this situation.
I suddenly thought of a chance to break free from the powerful CEO.
I slapped myself hard on the ear: "I'm not human, I should die! I'm just a wicked woman, I don't even deserve to live!"
I pretended to wipe away tears: "I forgive myself and none of you should either. I have no right to continue living here and face all of you. I'm a criminal now, so I'll leave."
Qin Zhide overheard my plan and her eyes lit up with understanding, turning to the CEO and saying: "If sister insists on leaving..."
The CEO snorted: "It's not that easy."
I was shocked.
Not only did she fail to escape, but I also got caught by Zhao Jianhao and locked in my room.
Before I knew it, it was nighttime, and I heard the door burst open as two black-clad bodyguards rushed in to grab me and drag me out.
Definitely, they were going to take me away for execution!
I struggled and kicked but couldn't move them at all.
I tried to reason with them: "Brothers, I've been miserable enough. Please don't send me to the slaughterhouse! If I have any last words, you're accomplices!"
The two men glared at me, their faces like steel.
They told me to say it to the CEO instead.
I felt a chill run down my spine as they gripped me firmly, terrified that if I spoke out of turn, they would take drastic action.
As I looked at their hard bodies, I couldn't speak.
If I made them angry, I'd be wrapped up like Swiss cheese and tossed into a suitcase!
Just then, Zhao Jianhao arrived with his car at the hospital, waiting for me outside.
Wait a minute – didn't the plot imply that Qin Yavi was oblivious because the CEO had never explicitly said he wanted to kill her yet?
I clenched my fists in determination: I'll bet everything on this.I squeezed out two tears, pretending to be worried and weak, saying to Tian Hao, "Tian Hao, I heard Zhan Zhiwen was sick, I want to go see her."
Two big men were startled, and it was said that women could change their faces so quickly according to legend.
I and Zhao Tian Hao arrived at Zhan Zhiwen's hospital room, where she was lying in bed with an IV drip,
I cried as I rushed up, my eyes welling up with tears grabbing onto Zhan Zhiwen's hand: "My dear sister, what's wrong?"
Zhan Zhiwen smiled wryly, saying, "Brother, it's my kidney."
What was she talking about, trying to change the subject? I wouldn't let her!
I sat on one buttock on the ground, clutching my stomach in agony: "It hurts so much, my kidney hurts!"
"Qin Yuxi, your kidney isn't there," Tian Hao coldly said out of nowhere.
I paused, how could I have been so careless? Stay calm, it's even more important to stay calm when things like this happen.
I looked at him with a soft gaze: "Pain has transferred."
Zhan Zhiwen and Zhao Tian Hao stared at each other. It seemed they were saying: ""What is this all about?"" "How can I know what's going on?"
I trembled as I pulled out the kidney pendant from my bag, trembling with excitement as I poured half a bottle of kidney pills into my mouth.
Zhao Tian Hao muttered lowly: "Continue pretending."
He didn't believe it.
Suddenly, I had an idea, pretending to faint could avoid 99% of the situation. So I fainted.
Then I was lifted onto the bed and pushed towards the emergency room. I was shocked, this couldn't happen in the emergency room, or I'd be caught!
Fortunately, Zhao Tian Hao was busy taking care of Zhan Zhiwen, so he didn't notice me following him. When my eyes opened, I saw a doctor and nurse's face, followed by a quick glance at the blanket to see if anyone was watching, before I sprang off the bed and ran downstairs.
Finally, I reached the ground floor and pushed open the door to the street, seeing the bright sunlight ahead.
I gasped loudly, and I crashed into the glass door!
This who had polished the glass so brightly?
"Rainy, don't worry, follow me,"
I turned my head to see a young man with clear facial features and white skin. I was sure he was the sad male lead, Cold Chaser Qing Chen.
He held onto me as we ran up to the second floor, where two bodyguards were smoking. We again ran up to the third floor, to the end of the hallway, where I saw a window, my heart racing: "You're not going to make me jump, are you?"
He looked at me with a warm smile and said: ""Rainy, what are you talking about?""
I saw him pull out a rope, binding one end to the door handle of the room next to us, and then wrapping it around our waist. He picked me up and lifted me over the window, letting the wind blow through my hair, I felt the taste of freedom, ah, this is too sweet!
Maybe I was getting too excited, my head hadn't even left yet, when I saw Zhao Tian Hao appeared.
Only to see him holding a watermelon knife against the door handle's rope,
"Zhao Tian Hao don't be impulsive!"
This is on the third floor!
"Qin Yuxi, you're not saying your kidney has a problem?""You know about mistaken identities? Mistaken identities."
Cold Chuan opens his mouth, "Zhao Lin Hao, you're beyond reason. You're not good for Rain Yi, and you won't let me take her with us."
Zhao Lin Hao sneers, "My woman will stay by my side even if I don't want to. It's only because she has to."
"Not this again, brothers, stop arguing about whether we should go or not! Have you seen us hanging around here all day? Let me get back downstairs first!"
Zhao Lin Hao ignores me and then warns Cold Chuan, "Cold Chuan, you have ten seconds to choose between Rain Yi and the Cold Group. 
"Zhao Lin Hao is being obstinate,"
I'm helpless, so you can just keep arguing. I want to sleep."
"10... 9... 8... 7... 6... 5... 4... 3... 2..." The CEO pulls out his phone and dials a number, speaking in a cold voice, "Five minutes, I'm going to acquire the Cold Group."
"Zhao Lin Hao, Rain Yi is back, I'll leave first."
Cold Chuan then quickly tosses me up onto the rope, and he himself descends down the rope, disappearing.
"Waaaah... I was promised a warm male lead and an awesome set of wheels! Ahh, but how could I have been so careless?! 
I fall to my knees in front of Zhao Lin Hao's body, staring at his well-tailored Western-style pants and shiny Italian handmade leather shoes."
Before he can speak, I receive a text message from Cold Chuan: "Rain Yi, wait for me until I'm strong enough..."
"I don't want to wait. I want to leave now."
The CEO bends down and pulls my chin upwards, "Want to leave? There's no way."
I slump forward, looking like I've lost all hope.
He discreetly pulls out a kidney bean pill from his pocket and says, "Zhao Lin Hao has found the source of your kidney problem, you don't need these."
Aha! That means I saved my kidney!
After the scandal surrounding Zhao Lin Hao's kidney transplant, exhausted me sits up on the bed and carefully goes through everything that happened recently. Following the storyline, I had accompanied Cold Chuan abroad five years ago and should have returned to China by now, but here I am again?
Scrolling thru my phone, I see a news article from Cold Chuan:
"Rocked by Scandal: Second Generation of the Cold Group's Zhao Lin Hao Marries Rain Yi in Secret Getaway to Hawaii - No Return Date Given."
I'm speechless 
Cold Chuan: "Rain Yi, after releasing this news, Zhao Lin Hao will no longer bother you. You have to wait for me."
I'm still in shock 
But it turns out that I actually did travel abroad 
So how am I supposed to fill the five-year gap left by the storyline?
Since my perspective is lost, all I can do now is follow their moves and take advantage of Zhao Lin Hao's absence."
Luckily, Qin Zhilu has been staying in the hospital for a few days and won't return anytime soon.I put down my phone and was just about to fall asleep, when Zhao Tianhao burst into the room and said his grandmother had arrived, asking me to talk to her.
I quickly realized this was an opportunity I couldn't afford to miss. Yesterday I had let a chance slip away from me as I watched it walk out of my hands, but today I must seize it firmly!
Zhao Tianhao's grandmother had always recognized me as his prospective daughter-in-law when she first met me because I was innocent and charmingly polite. So, I deliberately acted the opposite to spite her.
So, I quickly transformed into a sultry makeup look with bold lips and wore a barely-there push-up bra and short skirt.
Even if my grandmother is still open-minded enough to see me like this, she must be embarrassed for me!
I hurried down the stairs, Zhao Tianhao saw me dressed like that and was frozen in shock for a moment, but his grandmother didn't even bat an eye, and warmly invited me to sit down.
"Rain, you look so unique today!" His grandmother complimented.
Me: !!
I'm staying calm, I must stick with the plan.
"Grandmother, do you know how many times I wear this kind of dress every day? It's really refreshing not to have to deal with people like Zhao Tianhao who always wear boring clothes. He looks so out of place compared to me."
Zhao Tianhao suddenly said: "Qin Rain, be careful what you say."
Me pretending to only now react, covering my mouth quickly again and laughing, "Oh I was just joking around, my grandmother, don't mind Zhao Tianhao, he's just being too uptight. My clothes aren't that bad, grandma, you shouldn't be embarrassed for me."
Zhao Tianhao stood up, scolding me: "You're pushing your limits!"
Before I could respond, his grandmother was already furious and waving her cane at the ground, as if it were a red flag.
How dare she get angry?
His grandmother just yelled at me, letting out an even more fierce storm than before:
"Qin Rain, why are you speaking like this?" His grandmother scolded, her face flushed with anger."
I was about to say sorry when his grandmother said: "Tianhao, go apologize to Qin Rain right away."
Zhao Tianhao responded by shouting: "!!"
Me: ????
It hadn't even given me a chance to digest the situation yet, but my grandmother then affectionately took my hand and said:
"Rain, don't mind it. Tianhao is that way, but you look beautiful today, and your clothes are really cute. When you get older, you won't be able to wear things like this anymore."
I remained silent.
It seems I made a mistake on the path I chose.
Outside the window, the sky was blue without any clouds, with big fluffy white clouds drifting lazily by. The gentle summer breeze rustled through the leaves of the trees as I sat in silence, Zhao Tianhao tossed me a revealing lingerie dress 
"Hey, why not?"
"You're the one who loves wearing such clothes, right? Tomorrow, you'll be going to meet some clients to play golf, wear this for them."
I get it, that's exactly what they're looking for.
If I'm lucky, maybe they'll bring back some male lead character with a spotlight around him. But there's still a small chance...
After careful consideration, I decided not to take risks, and instead pretend to be Zhao Tianhao's wife.
But since my husband is already infamous in public for his private affair with Cold Tran, no one would ever believe me if I said I was his wife, anyway.The roads were all jammed.
I was frantic, thinking of a way to resolve the crisis after exhausting my brain, and finally found a solution.
Since I unexpectedly won over the grandmother-in-law of my boss today, my boss is no longer restricting my activity range, but I have to have a bodyguard with me wherever I go.
Oh, forget it, I don't care about having or not having a bodyguard.
So...
---
The next day, I was still half asleep when Lee-ma came knocking on my door and told my boss that I should get dressed up and come out. I stretched, yawned, and slowly got up, washed, and changed into some clothes.
When I came downstairs, Lee-ma was still on the phone, informing Zhao Shuangao about me. She seemed surprised when she saw me coming down.
I elegantly walked to the golf course, with a strong wind blowing my hair around.
Looking at Zhao Shuangao and his clients, they had already been playing for a while.
From their expressions, I could tell that they didn't have good intentions towards me, and even Zhao Shuangao's face showed dissatisfaction.
I quickly approached him, holding onto his arm, and began to act out a scene: "Oh no, why did you wake me up? I was just sleeping!"
We were all staring at each other with black lines on our faces, my boss growling: "Qin Yuyue, stop it!"
I nodded and turned away, only to see everyone looking at us strangely, whispering to each other, while Zhao Shuangao looked confused.
Ha ha, I just wanted that effect.
Now you're going to be the one to figure this out!
I said to my boss with a smile: "Love, do you think this dress looks good on me?"
I was saying that when I started walking around him in circles, and he suddenly got angry, grabbing my arm: "Qin Yuyue, did you know about the acupuncture treatment? Why are you so interested in it now?"
"Ah, I've been feeling really humid lately, and even then, I'm still constipated all day. Someone told me that acupuncture could help, so I went to get one.".
I ignored Zhao Shuangao's deteriorating mood and said: "I was going to get the whole red ace of hearts on my back from the acupuncturist, but there wasn't a heart-shaped needle."
There were some snickers from the crowd.
I turned around with my back to him: "Are you not recognizing it as the red ace of hearts?"
He scrunched up his face, trying to contain his anger, and said: "I think it's like three sticks!"
Everyone else couldn't hold in anymore and burst out laughing.
For the rest of the day, I was constantly being called "red ace of hearts".
"Hey, red ace of hearts, come over here."
"That... what's its name? Red ace of hearts. Go get me some water."
Throughout the day, I kept watching Zhao Shuangao's expressions, worried that he might get angry and knock me down with a golf club, but fortunately, it didn't happen.
Only when I left did he start his sports car, and I slapped him on the face with a firecracker.
This guy is too cautious!
Although I successfully dodged the crisis, my whole day was filled with joy.However, a bowl of cool water was thrown at me almost instantly.
I had just finished washing and was about to go to bed when my grandmother called, asking why I had married Zhao Lei for so long without ever having any children, especially since I wasn't even showing any signs of pregnancy yet.
What should I do now?
I called Zhao Lei, who replied with two words: "Don't go!"
At the same time, my grandmother was blowing up on WeChat:
Link 1: "Surprise! I got married to my husband for years and never had a child, only because of this."
Link 2: "The little habits that men tend to ignore are the main causes of infertility."
Link 3: "I've been very sad since getting married without having any children."
Me: 
Since Zhao Lei didn't want to go, I called him again, but he just hung up on me.
How can I make him come with me to the hospital for a check-up now so that I can tell my grandmother the truth?
I thought about it for a while and decided to force him.
The next day, I went to xxx Hospital and made an appointment as an expert, sending Zhao Lei a text message while waiting in line.
Finally, my turn came, and I met a 60-year-old doctor who introduced himself as the person I needed to see.
"Doctor, actually, it's not me you need to see, but your husband. He's too embarrassed to come."
The doctor looked uncertain: "You're better off asking him yourself if you want to get accurate information."
After confirming my appointment details, Zhao Lei sent me a text message: You really went to the hospital!
I didn't respond.
He then called me again, and I pretended not to answer. 
At this point, the doctor started asking me questions: "emm is better than bitter melon?"
I shook my head: "It's not that different."
The doctor looked surprised: "Is it better than peeling off a small banana?"
"Also not that much." 
The doctor was shocked and slowly raised his thumb, and I then extended my finger slightly, which made the doctor look uncomfortable.
He wrote down his diagnosis on a piece of paper without saying anything but with a knowing expression.
I walked out of the hospital room, checked my phone, and found that Zhao Lei had sent me seven to eight texts: "You're going to die!"
"How can you not feel it?"
"You're just lying!
"Again, be careful! You've annoyed me!"These text messages were nothing but a warning, I wasn't afraid at all, who wouldn't know that a CEO is always prone to making remarks like that?
Although the doctor's prescription was written in a wavy and curved style, it looked impossible to read. So I found a nurse and asked her about it, and she said it was a semen health examination.
Oh my god, this is too exciting!
I called Zhao Li Hua with excitement in my heart, only one ring and he answered, "Qin Yu Wei!" three words warned me.
"Boss, don't be angry first, the doctor gave you a sperm vitality test, look at your schedule when to come by, if not then this money is wasted altogether."
"I don't care about that money, I won't go!"
"But Grandma is staring at us for the examination!"
I sighed: "If you're really not willing to come, I'll let cold wind from him find something and send it over with a private plane, maybe by then my little mosquito will be unable to swim."
Zhao Li Hua:「……" He said, "I'm going there now!"
He actually arrived very quickly, did the examination, and reported that everything was fine, when the doctor patted my shoulder and said with a serious tone: "You should be more worried about your husband, he...isn't easy..."
I smiled slightly, nodded firmly.
Zhao Li Hua was still in a bad mood, I chose not to provoke him, being Zhao Li Hua's eyes were like needles that pierced my skin.
But I made a mistake, Zhao Li Hua didn't wait for me to get on the car before pressing the accelerator to its limit, leaving only a cloud of dust behind. Only one could see the Ferrari driving away.
You think I couldn't drive?
I opened my phone and received a text from Zhao Li Hua: "You can't even drive a taxi, your card has been frozen, payment apps are all blocked, forget it!"
I:「……"
I pulled out two coins that were all I had left in my pocket, tears streamed down my face.
On the way back when the sun was already high in the sky, Zhao Li Hua still hadn't given me any leftovers.
I sat at the dinner table, rubbing my sore toes while sucking a warm bowl of Gongji bean paste soup. Unintentionally, I saw Zhao Li Hua's phone on the chair next to it.
I excitedly picked up the phone, "Ha Ha Ha."
Maybe I was too tired in the day, I fell asleep as soon as I lay down.
One night passed.
In the morning, Zhao Li Hua woke me up early and ordered Lee Mom to pick me up with files. I held onto the file on my lap while yawning again and again on the bus. Only thinking about the two coins I still had in my pocket made me smile.
When I arrived at the company, I met Zhao Li Hua again who was wearing a well-fitted suit walking towards me. Behind him were a group of small henchmen. "Hey, here's your file."
I said with a smile as I handed him the file and pulled out his dropped phone: "You forgot to pick it up!"
He took the phone and file from me and told me to leave: Ha Ha Ha, laugh away, you haven't seen my handwriting yet!
"Boss, I didn't eat breakfast so I gave you this file. There's a tea room there. Want to go get some food?"
I added fuel to the fire: "You see all those people staring at us, are you going to deceive me like that?"
He said with a smile: "You look like a fierce woman, almost as bad as her."
Zhao Li Hua walked towards me with a smile, I chose not to irritate him.I just got into the elevator with them.
I glanced at the time and estimated that it was about to arrive. I felt excited to the point where my heart was pounding rapidly.
Suddenly, someone's phone in the elevator started making an indescribable noise, with the volume quite loud. The sound echoed all around the elevator, deafening and accompanied by 3D surround sound effects.
Everyone tried to stifle their laughter but couldn't help it anymore.
 Zhao Lin frowned his brow, coldly scolding: "Who is it?"
No one spoke up.
Just then, the noise changed into a series of cartoon-like sounds: Didi ~ Dee Dee ~ La la ~ Pole er, Tenline Baby ~ Tenline Baby ~ I want, Baby Milk!
The moment that sound came out, no one could hold back anymore and burst out laughing with their bellies full.
Zhao Lin suddenly realized what was happening, hastily pulled out his phone from earlier and found the alarm clock going off. He frantically turned it off, scowling at me: "You must have done this!"
No one spoke up.
Just then, that noise changed into: Didi ~ Dee Dee ~ La la ~ Pole er, Tenline Baby ~ Tenline Baby ~ I want, Baby Milk!
Now we all couldn't help but laugh uncontrollably again.
Zhao Lin suddenly woke up to reality and quickly pulled out his phone. After discovering the alarm clock was ringing, he frantically turned it off, scowling at me: "I almost would have died if my eyes could shoot arrows!"
Although I had annoyed him, he still allowed me to go to the restroom.
However, since I ate too much in the restroom, now that it's late dinner time, I don't even feel like eating anymore.
I felt sorry for myself, but unfortunately, I couldn't try the bossy auntie's chicken soup.
Zhao Lin had always looked gloomy during the day and didn't have a good expression. I think I played a trick on him and knocked down his dignified image right in front of everyone.
If I did something to make up for it...
I thought about that bowl of chicken soup.
If it's not too late, maybe I could warm it up and ask him to share some.
I took the chicken soup out of the kitchen and Li Mama comfortingly said: "Mrs. Chairman finally woke up, that's just right! Your husband and you didn't even look like enemies a few days ago."
Good grief, Li Mama, don't be misunderstood!
Just as I was thinking about Zhao Lin, he should be back soon. Li Mama got up from the guest room to start setting out the dishes.
I opened the pot and the aroma of the chicken soup wafted through the air, but it felt slightly less rich than before.
Oh right, ginger.
Only Tenline Boss eats fresh ginger slices, not ginger mince.
I searched all around the cupboard until I finally found a piece of ginger in the corner. I scooped out a little bit and added it to the soup.
When I brought out the pot to serve, Zhao Lin was already back sitting next to me at the table.
He sarcastically laughed at my enthusiasm, talking sweetly to Li Mama about how much I loved him.
It seemed like he had made up his mind not to drink the chicken soup, and it would be a waste if I didn't tell him. So I truthfully told him that it was his auntie's chicken soup.
Only then did he finally take two sips of the soup, looking miserable with an expression.
As soon as he put down his chopsticks, his face turned white again, his brow furrowed in pain, and he said: "Qin Ruiyi, what did you add to the soup?!"
I was startled by him so I panicked:
"No, I didn't add anything. Just a little bit of ginger."
Li Mama looked shocked, quickly saying: "Did Mrs. Chairman put some of the most innermost barberry jam into it?"
"Ah..."
 Zhao Lin suddenly realized something and scowled at me.
 Li Mama's face lit up with surprise, saying: "Mrs. Chairman must have added it!" Zhao Linhao bit his lip and said, "Are you kidding me?!"
He finally couldn't hold it in anymore, jumped up with a fart, taking small steps towards the toilet. I stood outside the door and could clearly hear the sound of someone going to the bathroom above.
After a while, he calmed down, took a deep breath, and asked weakly, "Did you really go?"
"Qin Yuyi, don't talk to me right now!" his voice was shaking slightly.
"No, no, I swear, I only added that... baobao mousse that looks like ginger,"
His vice president let out a low growl, "Ah! It's probably grandma's!"
"What? Grandma did what?"
"It's definitely medicine!"
I: "..."
It seems grandma really wants to hold the baby.
A healthy adult can pass one to five days of diarrhea, Zhao Linhao only had it for two days. For dinner, he was too scared to eat a single bite and would immediately spit it out if he swallowed it.
Right now, in this special time period, he still went to work.
"You're going to die from dehydration! How can you talk during the meeting like that?"
"I'll try to hold it in," he replied, "I have an important conference tomorrow and next week is a bidding war."
"One billion yuan!"
"How did you know?"
I shrugged, I knew this scene was classic CEO.
The stubborn vice president couldn't be stopped from going to work...uh, the office truck.
I felt a bit sorry for him because of my own mistake that made someone's life miserable. So I sent him a message saying I cared and apologized: "Hey, you looked so exhausted yesterday and today, were you in pain? Did you have any bleeding?"
This message was as quiet as an iceberg, will he even see it?
I already imagined the CEO collapsing from diarrhea-related dehydration, lying on the street with no one around, a dramatic photo of him dying alone.
I felt more anxious, decided to go to work and check on him.
When I arrived at the office hall, I heard two female colleagues discussing, "Can you believe our top-rated captain is actually...the guy from the Bayanao dock!"
"Even if he's bent into a mosquito candle, it's still surprising! But I didn't expect him to be that guy..."
What? I missed something? How did I not know Zhao Linhao was gay?
The female colleague continued discussing, "That scene was so vivid. Luckily, the secretary was using his phone to project on the screen at that time...you made it up, right?"
I: "..."
I estimated it wouldn't be easy for me to talk to him now.
I went back home with a feeling of emptiness in my heart, picked up my phone again and put it down, thinking I'd wait until Zhao Linhao came back before doing anything.Still, let's take a look at Zhao Yang Hao's mouth first.
I opened WeChat and typed out a row of characters with shaky hands: How are you?
After taking a glance, I clicked send).
Then I saw a red exclamation mark .....
Did he delete me?
I tried to add him as a friend again by clicking on the "Add Friend" button, but there was no response whatsoever.
Hmph, can't say it now, maybe when he comes back I'll eat my words. Maybe I should let him have his fun first. At least I can vent out this pent-up anger that's been building up for so long.
So I typed:
 Zhao Yang Hao, you're just trash, dressing like a loser all the time, acting like an idiot with your two-hundred-five temper. And to top it off, wearing those ratty old clothes!
After sending the message, I felt a sense of relief wash over me. Finally, I could vent out my anger at him.
But when I looked again, his profile picture was still there, and he had received my angry message!
 Zhao Yang Hao: ...... I'm too lazy to scold you anymore, I'm exhausted 
My response:
I just wanted to see if I could send it 
 Zhao Yang Hao: ... I've already gotten tired of scolding you, I'm too tired 
The next thing I knew:
 Zhao Yang Hao: A few minutes ago, Grandma called and asked me to go pick up some dried melon with you 
My response:
You're the CEO of the company, what business do you have to take care of? And why aren't you going to meet up with Ramzi who's about to be discharged from the hospital? 
I waited for half an hour, but he didn't show up.
3.

Escape from Crazed Hens
The next day, I was woken up by Zhao Yang Hao, and he told me we had to go pick up Grandma 
I was annoyed. I thought maybe yesterday when I reminded him that he needed to meet up with Ramzi who's about to be discharged, he just decided to skip picking up dried melon for Grandma 
But it looks like Zhao Yang Hao is actually afraid of Grandma 
This trip only had me and Zhao Yang Hao in the car, which means we were on a predictable collision course. I definitely didn't want this script for our heroine anymore. Why did I have to write this heroine as a pig feet? Instead of a cute puppy boy lead. 
I sighed: "Why can't you be a cute puppy boy?"
He turned his attention back to the road, gripping it tightly: "Do you like cute puppy boys? If we go out to buy one, why not?"
「…… Cute puppy boy dad, please shut up and focus on driving!If previously translated content is also given, use it as reference.

Carry on becoming more and more isolated, I am startled, maybe my grandmother's house is in the countryside?
It was really just a minute and then everything became a dense forest.
The forest is …..
I feel anxious, under the dark moon and high wind with small trees scattered all over, a car stranded, an only man and woman, dry firewood …
Oh no, please don't!
It's true, the car suddenly stopped.
I ask in my throat, "What happened?"
"Maybe it was stranded.")
I'm silent.
I just say it, I just say it!
Zhang Liangao gets out of the car to check, and I suddenly feel a sudden urge to urinate. I then think about how long it's been since I've gone to the bathroom. So, I get out of the car and plan to find a secluded place to relieve myself.
After walking for a while, I can still see Zhang Liangao's figure in the distance, so I continue to walk into the forest, hiding from his view.
Relieved after using the restroom, I feel light-hearted. Just as I'm about to pull up my pants, I notice something in front of me, and upon closer inspection, it's a snake .....
"Ahahahahaha!!!! Snake!!!!!!!" I scream while holding up my pants and running away, "Zhang Liangao, come quickly!!!"
I don't dare look back, just rushing forward, running fast, but faintly hearing Zhang Liangao calling out my name.
"Zhang Liangao!"
Just as I think everything is okay, I feel a branch grab at my leg and fall down. I trip and fall to the ground. 
"Qin Yuyue!!!!" Zhang Liangao rushes over, helping me up, "How are you? Where did you fall? Are you hurt?"
I twist my ankle, it hurts, I grit my teeth.
"Zhang Liangao, there's a snake, there's a snake!" I say while limping and leaning on him, "It was chasing me.")
He asks where the snake is, and I reply, "I don't know, it chased me just now."
Big mouth, I take a deep breath and look forward, "Is it gone?"
Zhang Liangao relaxes a bit, then looks at my foot again, smiling, "It seems like you're not going anywhere today."
"Are you saying that in person? Are you seriously letting go of me, this beautiful girl?" I say with a sigh.
"Not anymore." he smiles back.
"Shh...." Zhang Liangao suddenly makes a hushing motion with his hand, "Listen carefully, it sounds like something."
I listen closely and see a noise coming from not far away, which looks like the sound of a wild pig ….
Zhang Liangao and I face each other.
"Wild pig!" I scream, frightened and ignoring my ankle pain, jumping onto Zhang Liangao's back.===== CONTENT TO TRANSLATE =====
"Where are you going?"
I was being carried by Zhao Linhao through the woods, with a wild pig still behind us, whining and snorting at us. I was getting anxious: "Is it painful for pigs to lift humans? Let's hurry up... no, wait, let's go that way!"
Zhao Linhao: "Qin Yuwei, don't pull my hair!"
I: "You've run back the wrong way, you have to turn right!
Zhao Linhao: "Don't grab my hair and try to steer me, my hair is not a steering wheel!
I: "No, no, no, that's not right!
Zhao Linhao: "Don't pull me like a horse, I'll brake if you want me to!
"Wait, where are we now?" I thought the environment looked so unfamiliar.
Whining and snorting... 
"Oh my god, it's catching up!"
Zhao Linhao was panting and gasping for air as he continued to carry me, muttering: "Don't say anything, little one!
"Okay."
It turned out he had excellent direction sense, and we could see our car ahead of us. He opened the door first and threw me onto the seat before climbing in himself.
I looked out the window and saw that the pig was following us all the way, circling around the car once before approaching it from behind.
"What's it doing?" I was nervous.
Just then, the car started shaking violently.
I shivered with fear. Why did pigs like to lift vegetables? And why did they have to bend our backsides too?
Zhao Linhao and I didn't dare get out of the car. Time passed one minute by one minute.
"We're going to have to spend the night in this thing."
The car... 
The moon was full, the wind howling, a lonely man and woman, in the car...I don't want to.
Just when I was feeling anxious, I heard the sound of roaring motorcycles coming from not far behind. I hurriedly opened the car door and got out, Zhao Linbao also came down, and indeed saw two motorcycles approaching.
I quickly stopped the motorcycle and asked them where they were going. They told me they were heading to Lianhua Village.
"Ah, we're also going to Lianhua Village, can you guys pick us up? The price is negotiable," I said. "Look at our cars, it's been broken for days, and the sun is setting, there are wild pigs around, it's really scary."
The two brothers agreed quickly and told us to sit behind them.
But then, the Emperor suddenly spoke up, "I can drive a motorcycle." He said that while pointing to one of the big brothers, "You go sit behind him, I'll take my wife."
The two brothers laughed and said, "Okay."
And so, Zhao Linbao finally drove me into the village.
The village was surrounded by mountains and water, with a dense forest of bamboo groves on either side. A narrow road ran along the edge of the fields, where some farmhouses were built, and in some yards, there were stacks of corn, occasionally you could see two or three small dogs lazily wagging their tails.
A short while later, an elderly woman with a kind smile came up to us, holding Zhao Linbao's hand. "You're that little Zhao who's getting married?" she said excitedly, pointing at me. "This must be your daughter-in-law."
Zhao Linbao nodded.
The old lady took my hand and said, "I didn't think you'd find a good husband for us. We thought you'd be stuck with him all your life, never marrying because of his bad temper."
"Big sister, don't worry about it,"
I ate several bowls of dinner, the farm-style pork was incredibly delicious.
It turned out that our hostess had called my mother-in-law earlier and asked us to stay for a night. However, since our car broke down, we couldn't leave until tomorrow, and maybe it wouldn't be fixed until the day after."
The old lady assigned us to a room downstairs, of course, which was.... I slept on the floor.
The night was incredibly quiet in the countryside, and I fell asleep quickly under such an extreme silence. 
I had a dream that wild pigs were chasing me, but just as I was getting scared, Zhao Linbao suddenly appeared with a shovel and chased them away.
It turned out that my hero was Zhao Linbao's sudden appearance with a shovel.
The sky gradually lightened, and outside the window, birds chirped, and cicadas buzzed.
I stretched my back, then realized I had fallen asleep on the bed. Low to the ground, I looked around and saw that my clothes were still there).
I got up, yawned, and went out, just to see a little girl chatting with Zhao Linbao outside.
Little Girl: "Brother, you look really handsome."
Zhao Linbao: "You're a beautiful girl too."
Mom, this is like a ghost story. When did the Emperor become so gentle?
Little Girl pointed at me and said, "Who are you, Grandma?"
I walked over to her and smiled and asked, "Why do you call him brother, but call me Grandma?"
"Because brothers look good, and ordinary-looking people are called Grandma,"
I was silent.
Zhao Linbao covered his mouth with his hands and burst out laughing, his cold face suddenly transformed into a warm smile.I couldn't help but freeze, laughing so wildly at him. He was actually pretty good-looking too.
Mochi asked the king again, "Brother, do you like me?"
"Of course I like you!"
"But why didn't you take your pants off? Our classmate Li liked me, and he took his pants off, saying it's a sign of liking."
Zhao Lin smiled at him, "…………"
I immediately got angry when I heard that. "That little Li is just teasing you, he was taking advantage of you!"
"Ah? What should I do?"
I told him, "If he continues to treat you like this in the future, you have to fight him and crush him."
Zhao Lin picked up Mochi and asked, "Where does that Li boy live? Let's go find him with Auntie!"
Mochi nodded.
When we found that little scamp, he was still playing with a few boys and balls.
Zhao Lin put Mochi down and furrowed his brow coldly. "Who is Li?" 
A group of small boys were clearly frightened by Zhao Lin's expression, the ball also stopped moving, pointing at one of them, "He!"
Li looked very composed, with a "being honest without any ulterior motives" look on his face, but it was definitely someone who thought he was a king. "Who are you?"
Zhao Lin asked, "Is that the boy who showed off his underwear to Mochi?" 
"Mind your own business!" Li still had a lot of spirit.
Zhao Lin raised an eyebrow, showing his cold and ruthless expression, bent down and grabbed Li's shoulder, directly lifted him up to eye level, with a voice full of threat, "Now tell me if it has anything to do with me?"
The group of small boys were terrified by Zhao Lin's fierce expression, cowered into my back.
Li looked shocked for a moment and suddenly started crying uncontrollably, his mouth still stubbornly saying, "It's just between Mochi and me, it doesn't have anything to do with you!"
"You dare to say something like that again? If you're not careful, I'll twist your head off!"
Li was now so scared that he started sobbing uncontrollably, "I won't be stubborn anymore! Mom, I want to go home!"
Zhao Lin put him down, continuing coldly, "You promise never to show off in front of girls again. Do you know what it means? It's just being reckless, abnormal, and rude. You have no dignity."
Li sniffled, rubbing his eyes with tears, "I understand, I won't do it anymore, waaaah……" 
I looked at Zhao Lin's cold expression, my heart couldn't help but burst out laughing. My protagonist is simply ruthless.
After collecting Li, Grandma was far away on a big rock shouting, "Zhao ah, hurry and go to the village's vegetable field with the tractor, help Uncle go pick vegetables!"
I really want to see how the boss drives the tractor, haha, think about it already makes me laugh.
I smiled awkwardly with my elbow, "Hurry up! Don't make Grandma and Uncle wait anymore."
He gave me a cold look before walking away, his face still set in a scowl as he drove the tractor.
I sat on the bank waiting for Zhao Lin to return, finally after what felt like an eternity, I heard a thunderous sound. I lifted my head and saw the tractor driving back with a full truck of vegetables, Zhao Lin's face was covered in dirt and his eyes sparkled with a big smile as he revealed two rows of white teeth.
I couldn't help but laugh again and again, Zhao Lin passed by me again and gave me an icy stare, I struggled to hold back my laughter.If previously translated content is also given, use it as reference.

There was this woman who came to Zhao Lei Luo during dinner, and through conversation, I found out that she was Liao Ke's mother. She had come to ask Zhao Lei Luo to go pick up her son because Liao Ke was not being disobedient to girls but was starting to disobey boys.
Me:「……"
Last night, it seemed like I heard a boy crying terribly.
The next day, the mechanic arrived early in the morning.
"Do you guys have been in an accident?" the mechanic asked us. "Your car's bumper is all dented."
Me:「……"
Zhao Lei Luo:「……"
We were both perfectly silent, not saying a word to each other.
When we got back home, Qin Zhi Huan had already been discharged for two days. I tried to avoid seeing her and avoiding another villainous confrontation.
Staying at home was too boring anyway, especially since Zhao Lei Luo had frozen my account, leaving me unable to move or do anything. Boredom and poverty meant I had to "travel a long distance" to go shopping at the supermarket.
I was choosing products when I saw a woman with a baby doll holding it tight, sniffling away with her nose. She was crying on and off while cooing at the doll.
I kindly asked her, "Sister, what's wrong?"
She burst into tears even more after my question, explaining that she worked at a spa, her husband had left, and her mother-in-law didn't get along well. Her child was feverish, and she needed to go to the hospital later that day. She didn't have time to take care of the baby.
My heroine's "angelic aura" shone brightly: "You bring the baby to the hospital, I'll help you out for a while."
So, I put on her work clothes and went to the spa.
The spa looked quite luxurious, with top-notch decorations. It seemed like a place where rich people would go.
I clumsily gave a massage to a customer, got up, and saw Zhao Lei Luo sitting in a VIP seat!
I was about to retreat when Zhao Lei Luo spoke up first: "Qin Ru Yi, how did you end up here?"
"I'm just going to work. I don't have time to chat with you. I need to prepare for the next customer." I said while walking away, looking back over my shoulder, fortunately he didn't follow.
A little while later, the manager came to me and said that there was a customer who wanted me to serve them. My heart sank, thinking it was Zhao Lei Luo again.
And guess what?
"I'm also not an ordinary woman," Zhao Lei Luo teased, looking at me with an amused expression.
Ugh, you're just trying to provoke me!
"You brought Qin Zhi Huan?" I asked.
"Are you jealous?" Zhao Lei Luo laughed from his bed, lying on his back.
"No, I'm not being jealous. You have a rough complexion anyway, let me give you some face cream." I grabbed a bottle that looked like lotion and said, "Is this something I can use?" because the label was in Thai characters, all of which I couldn't read.
Oh well, just go ahead and use it anyway. It wouldn't matter even if I messed up his face.
I squirted out a small amount onto Zhao Lei Luo's face and applied it gently: "Is this okay? Don't forget to give me five stars on the review. Mmm hmmm."
He didn't say anything, not even opening his eyes.Mr. Your legs are a bit rough too, I said, and then applied another dollop of that Thai moisturizer on his legs.
Then I started massaging it in.
Massaging it in… Oh my god! These black ones are what?
I leaned in closer to take a look.... This is Zhao Ling Hao's beard, oh no!
The stuff he put on is hair removal cream! If he knew, the consequences would be unimaginable!
I was sweating bullets, and his massage hand started to tremble slightly.
"How come?" Zhao Ling Hao seemed to sense that something was wrong with me.
I pretended to calm down: "Please forgive me, I'm just a rookie, no experience at all, haha."
I took a few deep breaths, trying to compose myself, thinking of something to say to him.
My eyes landed on his eyebrows again... those ones!
I held my heart in my hands and took slow steps towards him, trembling with fear, and lightly shaved off his eyebrows.
My heart skipped a beat when I saw the result. The thought of having no eyebrows was like becoming a different person in front of the mirror.
I couldn't hold it in anymore, asking timidly: "Sir, can I do your eyebrows for free?"
"Not necessary."
"Then sir, I'd like to recommend this excellent eyebrow technology from a beauty hospital."
He suddenly realized what was wrong and sat up straight, staring at his reflection in the mirror, furious: "Quin Rain Ao, where's my hair?".
I jumped back in fright, shaking my hands out in front of him: "They're right here! I didn't dare touch them."
I thought he would scold me severely, but he just let out a sigh of resignation.
A few days later, he called me to help him draw his eyebrows again. I was confused, and then saw the message on his phone from Qin Zhiwen about plans to go to the beach with Zhao Ling Hao:
"By the way, are you really going to go to the beach with Zhao Ling Hao?" I asked while helping him draw his eyebrows.
To be honest, I wish I could too. I've never been to the beach before this long.
"You want to come?" he raised an eyebrow... not that eyebrow...
I lit up: "Can we go together?"
The CEO turned down my request: "Let's see how you do with my eyebrows first. If your work isn't perfect, I won't take you to the beach, and I might even get rid of you."
"Okay," I promised.
To make it look as real as possible, I leaned in closer to examine his face.... He was smiling at me, enjoying the view.
A bead of sweat rolled down my back.
The beach trip was set for soon afterward.
I sat behind him, watching as he continued to pose with his high-end sunglasses on, still pretending to be cool and confident.If previously translated content is also given, use it as reference.

Oh my god, you're drawing so real! And wearing sunglasses too.
Sitting in the passenger seat, Qin Zidian hadn't expected me to come along either, and his heart was feeling quite upset, but he still had that friendly smile on his face: "Sister, I'm really sorry, Mingming should be sitting in the passenger seat, but I'm just too lightheaded from driving."
"No worries, no worries, you can sit here, I don't mind it at all."
We arrived at a five-star hotel by the sea, and I chose a room that was farthest away from Zhao Linhao, eager to change into my swimsuit and run down to the beach.
The ocean, the sand, and this muscular guy... I'm finally here!
The sun is blindingly bright, and there are many people at the beach. The sea is a deep blue color that stretches out endlessly. Waves of all shapes and sizes, glistening in the sunlight, make the vast expanse of the sea feel truly majestic.
I think the CEO and Zidian should be in their room making out, not coming here. As long as I don't get stuck with that evil female second lead, everything will be fine.
But then I suddenly saw a familiar figure standing there, surrounded by people, and his eyes kept drifting over to me: a beautiful girl like me... Ugh, what's wrong with you?
Cold Trao?!
Cold Trao's eyes locked onto mine the moment he saw me, and he quickly shook off the woman clinging to him: "Rain Violet, how did you end up here?"
It turns out Cold Trao had never left the country, always running around from one place to another... looking for a girlfriend.
My male protagonist... collapsed!
"Quin Rain Violet."
I turned my head to see Zhao Linhao standing right in front of me.

Even with sunglasses on, I could sense the coldness emanating from his eyes: "Really? You came all this way because you wanted to follow me?"
The CEO turned around and told me, "Rain Violet, let's go for a swim!
I didn't want to go, but looking at him with that furrowed brow, I had no choice but to nod.
He grabbed hold of me tightly as we walked along the beach and into the water: "I'm here to see my old girlfriend."
I didn't want to be around his possessive behavior, so I muttered: "There are too many people here. You shouldn't do anything rash."
But Zhao Linhao just said, looking at me with a scowl: "Don't say that!
His hands started roaming over my waist, and I tried to squirm away: "Zhou Linhao, what if you cause a scene? This beach is crowded!"
But he just laughed and said, his actions becoming more bold by the minute: "I dare not do anything rash."
My body froze in shock, and I didn't know what to do. Should I scream? No way. Other people would think it's just us being playful.
Zhao Linhao's hands kept wandering all over me, and I struggled while saying: "Zidian, Zidian where are you going? If you're not careful, your eyebrows will get washed away."
But he didn't flinch,
I thought for a moment before coming up with a plan and immediately put it into action.
His expression changed from laughter to seriousness, and his tone turned stern: "Let go of my hand!
Here.I forcefully pulled his beach pants and the inner underwear out to confront him: "Who made you act that way at me just now?"
"Qin Yueyi!"
"If you keep acting like that towards me, I'll tear your pants open,"
He quickly loosened my grip, putting both hands over his own pants: "You're going to die."
"I'm not afraid of punishment, so don't be gentle with me either," I said and tugged hard.
He held onto the pants tight, twisting his body to escape while constantly whining: "What's wrong with you?"
You still yell? Okay, I pull, pull, pull!
Why did I doubt it, I couldn't even pull him out of the water?
"Qin Yueyi, let go, stop pulling like that, or you'll tear everything apart!"
He shouted just as I was about to—
Groan——
My boss and Qin Yueyi instantly petrified.
His face turned a deep shade of blue: "Qin Yueyi!!"
I bowed my head and looked over, seeing his pants' straps flapping in the water, and his beach pants ripped in half.
Oh no... I trembled with fear, swallowing saliva, and stuttered: "It was you who started it."
"I order you to go get me a pair of underwear right now,"
I had no choice but to dash 500 meters to the hotel room, grab a pair of underwear, and then run back, out of breath.
Zhao Lingbao threw his underwear into the water: "Do you want me to wear that... pink lace-edged strawberry underwear?"
He held up both hands in front of him, looking proud: "I won't wear it, you have to find a man's underwear for me."
But where would I go find men's underwear?
"Shouldn't we get kid's toys instead?" I begged, "There are kids playing with sand over there. If you lend me a toy cannon, I'll use that to block your front, or if not, can you borrow two?"
Zhao Lingbao shouted: "Qin Yueyi, this is my last command! Get men's underwear for me!"
My boss had reached the edge of sanity, I didn't dare to provoke him anymore. Only nodded and rushed off to find the underwear.
From far away, I saw Cold Chai sitting on a bench, sucking through an straw at coconut milk.
I ran over: "Cold Chai, your four cornered underwear are really pretty. Maybe Adidas... ah, not Adidas..."
I froze in confusion for a moment: "Cold Chai, aren't you selling fake goods?"
He glanced down and confirmed it was indeed Adidas: "Hey, I'm going to ruin his store!"
"We should focus on saving face right now, old brother,"
I pulled him over to Zhao Lingbao's side, where he again fell into a deep scowl.
The boss seemed even angrier than before... Zhao Lin Hao put his hands behind his back and stared at Yang Cold with a mocking expression, "What are you doing here?"
 Yang Cold was taken aback by Zhao's sudden appearance. He said, "Stop joking, Li Xiao! Can't you just keep quiet for once?" 
He thought about Zhao Lin Hao's temper and didn't want to risk offending him.
I nervously cleared my throat and finally asked, "Yang Cold, do you have any extra underwear?"
 Yang Cold looked puzzled at first and then spotted a strip of fabric floating in the water. He burst out laughing, "Zhao Lin Hao, aren't you also having a bad day? Are you going to challenge me to a swim?"
 "Yang Cold, are you really still with the Cold Group?" Zhao Lin Hao's tone was stern.
 Yang Cold was momentarily stunned and then laughed again, "Just kidding, Li Xiao. My leg hurts and I don't want to go back to the hotel to get your underwear."
 I boldly stepped forward, "I'm not hurt, let me go get it."
 Yang Cold shook his head, "Oh no, my room card seems to be missing, sorry." 
 Seeing Zhao Lin Hao's face was about to turn red with anger, I rushed to calm him down, "Yang Cold, don't make a scene! Just give Li Xiao one hole in the underwear."
 Yang Cold and I said simultaneously, "I won't do it!"
 I tried to persuade him again, "Come on, now is not the time to be stubborn. Just let me have one hole." 
 Then I turned to Yang Cold, "Just agree with me, brother! I'm begging you, don't make Li Xiao cry." 
 But Yang Cold still wouldn't budge.
 In the end, Zhao Lin Hao's underwear problem was solved when he bought a plot of land and chased away all the tourists. The CEO was wealthy.
 I didn't dare to see Zhao Lin Hao after lunch, guessing that his mood wasn't good.
 Just then, Yang Cold approached me and asked, "Rain Vi, why did your underwear get damaged?"
 "I'm sorry." 
 Yang Cold looked confused and said, "You're really tough!"
 I hit him on the shoulder, "Where were you thinking? This isn't how it happened at all."
 Yang Cold changed the subject, "If things have already been resolved, why are you still frowning?"
 "I annoyed him, of course. He's probably thinking of ways to punish me." 
 Yang Cold suggested, "Why don't we go buy some gifts to make up for it?"
 I smiled, although I knew that the gift card belonged to Zhao Lin Hao.
 We spent half a day shopping at a store without finding anything suitable.
 I kept wondering what would bring happiness to someone.
 Suddenly, I spotted a row of small items on the shelf. Good, just looking at them made me feel better. Let's buy more!
 Yang Cold and I brought back a big stack of gifts to Zhao Lin Hao's room.
 Now the problem was how to surprise him with the gifts?
 We thought about putting the gifts under the bed cover with a blanket. When Zhao Lin Hao lifted the cover, he would see all the apologies and good intentions.
 But just as we finished everything, I heard voices outside.
Here is the rest of the translation:If previously translated content is also given, use it as reference.
赵霆皓怎么这么快就回来了？
We can't even walk anymore; under pressure we had to hide under the bed.
The voice got closer and closer. Qin Ruyan was there too.
"Glacier, I'm starting to doubt your feelings towards me," Glacier said with a hint of accusation, "You and I were meant to be together. Why have you suddenly started paying attention to Qingyue?"
"No, no, don't get worked up like that," Glacier replied while slowly opening the door with his house card.
As an honorary fan, I quickly opened my phone's camera from under the bed, so we could see what was happening from our screens. We saw them two huddled together in front of the screen.
"Are you loving me?" Qingyue asked, her eyes welling up with tears, "Glacier, I don't know how to live without you."
He didn't respond; he just pushed her away: "Go back to your own room. I need a shower."
Qingyue's body leaned against him again, whispering: "I've never seen you take a shower before..."
We heard her harsh words and were shocked to the point of being paralyzed with fear.
On our screens, Glacier sighed down, his face expressionless. His voice was firm: "Go back."
He turned around and started walking towards us, and we could see that he was almost at the bed. I frantically shook Cold's arm, trying to get him to know what to do next.
Cold just shrugged: "I don't know either."
On our screens, they were still talking face-to-face.
"Did you forget what you said earlier about loving me for life?" Qingyue asked, her voice trembling with tears.
Glacier fell silent.
I sighed in frustration; Glacier's words were surprisingly romantic.
Cold quickly switched off the camera mode and typed out a message on our screens: "This confession is really emotional. If you want to cry, I'll give you my shoulder."
But I didn't want to cry at all; I even wanted to keep watching. So I nodded with my mouth, but Cold just shook his head again.
Then Glacier waited for Qingyue's response, but she was too slow. Qingyue suddenly stood up and tried to kiss him, but Glacier pushed her away.
"Who is shouting so much?" Glacier shouted in anger, "It's you, Qingyue!!"
I shrank back into my neck in fear, and on our screens, the camera went off-screen and started popping chickens everywhere. It was like an explosion of squawking chickens all over the room. Glacier jumped up from his bed immediately.
"You put out too many loud squawks!" Glacier shouted again, "I know it's you, Qingyue!!"
Cold shrank back in fear; I also retreated into my neck because I couldn't bear it anymore. Then I saw more chickens falling down from the ceiling, their beaks popping up everywhere and clucking loudly.
"Glacier...," Qingyue wanted to say something, but Glacier cut her off: "Get out! Don't pretend like what happened never happened."
Qingyue took a few steps back, but then she tripped on one of the squawking chickens. It was so loud that it almost broke my eardrums.
"Glacier...," Qingyue tried to say again, but Glacier shouted: "I know you're there! Come out!"
Then I saw Qingyue slowly getting up from under the bed, Cold and me following close behind.I just crawled out from under my bed and ran away with sprinkles, Cold Wind didn't react like me, which had such high intelligence and intuition. All I could do was mourn him for three seconds.
Night fell, the starry night sky stretched endlessly, people playing by the sea gradually disappeared, entertainment venues were bustling with people, seafood restaurants started to boom.
Although I wanted to eat something good, I didn't dare to go out, fearing that I would meet Zhao Liang Hou again on a narrow road. A bored me opened King's Glory.
This game has been popular for years, and I still haven't played it, only yesterday did I pass the new user training.
Just logged in, Cold Wind invited me to team up, I agreed to see what happened, but I found that Zhao Liang Hou and Qin Zhi Huan were also there.
Cold Wind asked me to open my audio channel and communicate with him, but Zhao Liang Hou and Qin Zhi Huan hadn't opened theirs.
Cold Wind laughed at me, saying I was just a bronze-level player, it's just a copper.
I realized that Zhao Liang Hou had already become the strongest King's Glory, followed by Cold Wind, then Qin Zhi Huan's Starry segment.
Only my stupid dog head icon was stuck behind us, revealing a naive and innocent aura, marked with "stubborn Copper" words.
"Today they weren't at odds with each other, why are they now together?" I asked.
"It's me who dragged them over. With my years of experience, I think tomorrow they'll make up for it, anyway, don't bother with them. Rain Vi, I'm amazing at games, and next time I guarantee to bring you up." Cold Wind said.
"I thought Zhao Liang Hou was so high-level, isn't he always working? Where did he get the time to play?" I asked.
"I didn't hire a substitute," Zhao Liang Hou's voice suddenly came from my earpiece, shocking me.
After logging into the hero selection interface, I asked, "What should I choose? Can I pick Ariel?"
Cold Wind said, "Which one is it?"
"Anhngila," Zhao Liang Hou replied.
"Let me choose that one. Although holding a ball girl sword looks a bit ridiculous, but she's very beautiful and tall," I clicked to confirm.
"I'm picking heroes based on their value?" Zhao Liang Hou asked.
"You chose this hero for its good-looking face, huh?" "You're choosing the Ariel hero just for your own vanity"If previously translated content is also given, use it as reference.

Team All: You don't deserve to be my opponent.
[Team All] Are you MM or GG (Arataki)? Throw already.
Then several lines of green text pop up:
Team All: Love Vivi (Kan Eui): Don't brag first, wait until we beat you on the ground.
Ryukou (Xia Hou Edao): Sister, don't play for a while, I won't report you.
I feel uncomfortable, I'm depressed...
"Cold Chan, why didn't you take me with you?"
"What?"
"You have slow support speed, your horse can ride two people, but why didn't you let me get on the horse."
Cold Chan:「……"
He kept it up for ten minutes before his character got destroyed by the fire of the enemy dragon fruit and his stats were 0-12-3.
Let's take a closer look at Zhao Li Hua's Li Bai, 21-0-6.
Okay, I believe he's not looking for someone to carry him.

The opponent continues to spam:
Opponent: Good job, Li Bai brother!
Li Bai brother, I want to give you some monkeys!
Li Bai pulls me over.
I have been stuck in the middle lane with no place to stand, all on fire. There is no way for me to defend myself. 
Suddenly I feel that I can play, so I sent a big move to Li Bai.
Ha ha, praise me! I'm still useful.
Zhao Li Hua: "Qin Rui Vivi, what did you do by amplifying me?"
"You weren't on fire just now, I gave you fire to put out, and I didn't want to use it myself either."
「……you can't put out fire."
"Can't you, she has a phrase that says 'let him replace my fire'."
Zhao Li Hua:「……"
Gradually, the opponent's side was unable to withstand our team's dominance, Cold Chan shouted across the screen:
Opponent: Get down and beg, quickly!
[Team All] Are you MM or GG (Arataki)? Li Bai add a friend.
This message shows that the enemy crystal exploded because of it.
"I'm out of the game interface and found a notification, I click on it to see that I was deducted points.
"Cold Chan, why are you not saying we won't report me?"
"Maybe the opponent reported us."
Here is the translated content in English.“I don’t understand, why are you reporting me?”
“Shouldn’t you be reporting him… he’s an actor.”
Me: “…”.
We played on the beach for a whole day, because of the previous screaming chicken incident, Zhao Lin Hao didn't give me good looks at all, so I had to keep a distance from him.
Quickly we were about to leave, and I thought Zhao Lin Hao would leave me behind again, and take Qin Zidian away with him. But it turned out he also made me get on the car.
Cold Chuan was desperate to be carried too, Zhao Lin Hao didn't let him, and just said “roll” and stepped on the gas, speeding away.
Sitting in the passenger seat, Qin Zidian said, “Lin Hao, why do you have to drive me back home? Can’t I go to your house instead?”
“Not a problem.”
His next words completely woke me up. What was he thinking?
I don't understand what Zhao Lin Hao is thinking about anymore.

Talking to the kidnapper, and falling in love
The escape story: Let’s roll
View details
Three, talking to the kidnapper, and falling in love
The sky was a brilliant blue, with fluffy white clouds floating gently by, and the asphalt road was hot and humid, causing the air to feel stuffy.
We came back from the beach, and saw a boy sitting on the couch playing puzzles. He had big black eyes, like two empty sockets, and his skin was as white as porcelain. 
I laughed out loud at Zhao Lin Hao, “You have a son! Come and recognize him!”
He gave me a cold look with his tyrannical eyes, “That’s my nephew.”
Oh, I see, it’s Zhao Lin Hao’s 3-year-old nephew who came to visit us. I couldn’t help but admire the strong genes in their family, that little boy was cute and adorable, with lips as red as rubies and teeth as white as snow.
I couldn’t help but think about Zhao Lin Hao when he was younger, “He must be cuter than his nephew.”
“Little star, what’s your name?” I asked him, sitting down beside him, and for the first time, I saw that he was playing with a puzzle. It had to have hundreds of pieces!
This family is full of high IQs.
“The boy’s name is Xing,” he looked up at me with his big black eyes, “Auntie, what are you eating?”
Zhao Lin Hao corrected him, “You shouldn’t call her Auntie, you should call her Grandma.”
Forget it, I don’t care anymore, I just want to listen to him call me that.
“Grandma is eating bubble gum,” I pulled out a green arrow from my bag, “Do you want some Xing?”
“No, Grandma!”
Xing looked down his face, and his eyes welled up with tears, like he was about to cry.
I quickly comforted him, “Don’t listen to him, he’s just old-fashioned. Grandma’s bubble gum is for you.”
“Grandma!” 
He suddenly shouted again.If previously translated content is also given, use it as reference.
我没理霸总警告性地叫我全名，继续说道：「但你吃的时候必须时不时张开嘴给我看，看看口香糖还在不在。」
小程吸溜了下鼻子：「好。」
霸总见拦不住我，只好冷着张脸坐在小程旁边，便于观察他的一举一动。
小孩眼里满是惊奇：「哇，甜甜的，凉凉的，真好吃！»
「姐姐给你说啊，还有一种叫泡泡糖的玩意儿，可以吹泡泡呢。不过你现在还不能吃，得等你学会吃口香糖后才准许吃泡泡糖。」
我说。
「好！」
小程的嘴 vẫn đang嚼嚼嚼，但动作幅度不是很大，也常常忘记张嘴给我看，因此，我想到个办法。
「小程啊，口香糖还有个神奇的地方呢，就是你把他暴露在空气中，它会变硬得很硬很的，吃回嘴里又会变软。」
他眼睛一亮、「真的吗？」
「不信？试试呗。」我接着说，「你把口香糖放舌头上伸出来…»
他照做。
「什么感觉？」
「真的变硬了！」
只一会儿，我又继续说：「你把舌头缩回去，用温热的口腔包裹住它，再用舌头搅一搅…什么感觉？」
「变软了！不过没有刚才软。」
「好，我们再来。」我说，「舌头伸出来…»
「硬了！」
「舌头放回去…»
「软了！」
我还没说完呢，赵霆皓就气冲冲打断我：「行了，别说了！」
哼，你说不说就不说？好吧，我不说了。
我转头捏捏小程的脸，「小程现在学会吃口香糖了吗？」
他郑重地点点头，没一会儿竟开始小声嘀咕着：「硬了，软了，硬了……»
赵霆皓：「……"]
吃完口香糖后，小程明显和我亲近了许多，还邀请我和他一起看动画片。「What's that piglet's name?」 I asked.
小程 didn't take his eyes off the television, and replied, 「It's Peppa Pig, Peppa Pig.」
「He looks so cute.」
I felt my heart skip a beat as I looked at this little boy even more. When he grows up, he's bound to be better than Zhao Yanghao.
呜呋呋，我 also want a kid just like him!
赵杨皓 was just washing his face when he walked by, and suddenly blurted out, 「You're still watching that wind-up toy pig again!」
「Peppa Pig isn't a wind-up toy, it's not a pig!」小程 scolded, angry.
 「Zhao Yanghao, shut up!」 I scolded too, worried that little Cheng would cry. Zhao Yanghao's mouth was so impolite!
I calmed down little Cheng again, 「Peppa Pig is just so cute, it can't be a wind-up toy, not a pig!」
小程 nodded heavily and continued watching TV.
「But everyone says Peppa Pig looks like a wind-up toy, even the kids in kindergarten say so.」赵杨皓 teased little Cheng to get him hooked on TV.

「That's not true, no way! Uh-uh...」little Cheng burst into tears.
I comforted little Cheng, 「Uncle Zhao Yanghao is just saying nonsense, don't pay attention to him!」
But I couldn't bear it anymore. This was too much!
……
Against the backdrop of Zhao Yanghao's haircutting, I held little Cheng close and said, 「You have to get a haircut in January.」
赵杨皓：「……」
Tony said, 「Do you think your boss would like you to shave your head?」
赵杨皓 replied, 「Yes.」
「你 think it's good-looking or not?」 I asked little Cheng.
小程 rolled his eyes, „I guess it should be good-looking, but I still don't like Uncle Zhao Yanghao!」
Zhao Yanghao just cut off his hair and headed to work. I walked with little Cheng until lunchtime, watching an endless stream of poems.
It's undeniable that he inherited a high IQ gene from his parents. He read the poem only twice but somehow remembered it all!
I was both anxious and excited inside as we waited for Zhao Yanghao to return. Five and a half o'clock finally came when the door opened again. Zhao Yanghao walked in, wearing a black baseball cap on his head.
「Zhao Yanghao, why are you wearing that hat?」 I tried to stifle my laughter.
He scoffed, 「What do you mean? Are you saying I'm going to dance at a street festival or something?」
I and little Cheng exchanged a glance. We both suppressed a snicker. Zhao Yanghao was furious!
秦雨薇 „Zhao Yanghao, how could you have expected me to collude with your private Tony?!"""
「What's wrong with my Tony?!」 I pretended to be confused.
He turned around and pointed at the back of his head, 「Tell me!」I and Xiao Cheng looked at him after his head hair was shaved into a small Piglet Peppa, laughing even harder.
I thought Bao Zhao would come and play with me for several days of air, but he took me to the company the next day. He said it was to prevent me from "corrupting" Xiao Cheng under his eyes.
What does corrupting mean? What's an airhead?
I hadn't seen Xiao Cheng's first morning, I thought about him...
I had my first lunch with Xiao Cheng without eating together, thinking about him...
When I just got a cup of coffee, I saw Lin Yu-Xiu running towards us like a double-edged sword.
According to Bao Zhao's script, the female N number came to the CEO's office, blablabla...
She looked surprised and awkward when she saw me, explaining that she had just come from City投 company, saying Zhao Li-Hao was also there, and told her to go back and get a file for Xian Cang Company, very urgent.
I didn't know what time Zhao Li-Hao went out, but I didn't understand this business stuff, so I followed her anyway.
But she said that the agency had just called her, telling her to take pictures, and I was supposed to bring it to her. At the time, I didn't think it was a problem again, since I was feeling bored and wanted to do something. So I agreed without thinking.
When I was walking down a busy street with files in my hands, I suddenly realized that this file mustn't be sent! According to Bao Zhao's script, this must be a top-secret project of the CEO's company!
To avoid trouble, I opened the file bag and confirmed it - yes, this was indeed a new project's bidding document for the CEO's company!
I was furious, slapping my forehead, Qin Yu-Vi! Why are you so stupid?! Now what should I do?
Should I bring back the file? No way, they'll definitely think something fishy about it. Should I hide it in my bag? That's even worse than being caught!
I thought of going home and watching an animated movie with Xiao Cheng...
Ugh, Xiao Cheng! Suddenly a brilliant idea popped into my head...
When I returned to the company, Zhao Li-Hao was furious and asked me, "What did you take to Xian Cang?"
"Just one file," I replied honestly.
The employees stared at us in confusion, what was going on?
"Quin Yu-Vi, that's..."
I interrupted him and said, "Don't be so hasty, your file is here."
As I pulled out the file from my bag...
"He's just Quin Yu-Vi, the CEO's wife. Isn't she married to Cold Qing? Didn't they have an affair?" The employees were gossiping and looking at me with shocked expressions.
Bao Zhao looked relieved after seeing the file, but then asked again, "Did you copy it for Xian Cang?"
"You're just talking nonsense."
"What about the file bag?"
I said, my voice barely above a whisper, and suddenly the air froze...
Zhao Li-Hao's face turned bright red as he stuttered, "Quin Yu-Vi, really...":
He immediately walked into his office.When the staff gathered around, they all asked each other "General's wife, you really handed out that plate as a file to the semiconductor department?",
"Of course, but why are you all so shocked? Have you seen the plate before?"
They wildly shook their heads, "No, no, I only occasionally see it.",
I waved my hand at one of the most adamant staff members, "You're not married yet, right? I'll tell you, once you get married, plates like this will be hard to avoid, especially when you have kids, you won't even think twice about it."
They looked deep into each other's eyes, "I didn't expect the General to appear so cold on the surface but having that habit...",
"Hey, what are you all doing here? Have you finished work?" The CEO suddenly appeared behind me and ordered,
The staff dispersed like a startled archer,
I continued chatting with one of the female staff members about which cosmetics were good on Taobao,
"Hey, why is your computer screen showing a conference room?" I asked,
She replied, "This is their side, we secretly installed a camera there.",
I said, "That's not very right.",
She responded, "Don't mention it, they had a hidden microphone in our meeting room too."
I asked her, "Why didn't you guys set up any cameras on their side?"
The screen showed that she was about to start the meeting, and she immediately put down her nail polish and raised her voice, drawing everyone's attention,
"Look at this!" I said,
They all looked at the computer screen, expecting me to be holding a plate,
One by one, they were shocked and started staring at the screen,
Was that really my plate?
I thought to myself, "They're so concerned about company projects, it's touching."
The voice from the computer spoke up, "This is the materials from弘皓集团, we're thanking the brave guy who took a risk."
The room erupted in applause,
I suddenly felt embarrassed,
The meeting started,
Everyone held their breath and even one of them pulled out a laptop to take notes,
Finally, they started playing the video,
"Look at me, I'm just a sheep, but sheep are smarter than you think ~,"
The song was melodious, the scene was happy, several sheep were playing in the field,
The other side fell silent for half a minute before someone said, "This is not right.",
The CEO responded, "Shh, don't interrupt, there's useful information later, don't miss it."
They watched the entire episode of "喜羊羊与灰太狼."
I couldn't help but say, "My kids love this show at home."Employees：「……”.
After this incident with the broken plate, Zhao Lin Hao stopped worrying about me going to work and said I was always causing trouble.
“Then don't bother keeping an eye on me, let me go find a job somewhere.” I suggested.
“They wouldn’t dare. Don’t they know that I can take care of you?”
I：「……”.
The CEO doesn't work overtime, Small Program goes to the interest class, which is perfect for my chance to sneak out and eat street food.
I arrived at the bustling street food street, with people shoulder to shoulder, food wafting in every direction, making your mouth water just by smelling it. However, I spent only forty minutes there, only eating a chicken claw.
After that, I went shopping in the mall again, unfortunately, my wallet was too thin, and I could only buy one pair of shoes. When I came out, I realized it was already dark and gloomy.
I hailed a taxi: “Taxi, Clond Bay Apartment Complex.”
I opened the window and watched the street scene retreat into view, feeling the gentle breeze of summer evening, the smell of freedom.
“Oh no, driver! This is not the way to Clond Bay Apartment Complex. Are you trying to trick me or something?!” I said.
“The lady, I'm not that kind of person.”
It wasn't until later that I found out, you're actually not that kind of person, but a kidnapper.
Oh no, why did this happen?
Even though it follows the script, the CEO should have saved me, but he chose to take an unconventional route instead.
My hands and feet were tied down, locked in an old warehouse with four walls, only the roof had a small window. Every time I spoke, my voice echoed back.
There were two kidnappers inside the warehouse.
Even if we made a scene and someone died, it would probably not be discovered anyway. I felt terrified, was I going to die here?
“I need to go to the bathroom.” I said.
“One of them pointed to a broken bottle in the corner of the wall: “There’s a urine bottle.”
I decided not to use it.
“You don’t know why you’re kidnapping me, do you?” This skinny kidnapper who had a scar on his face asked.
“Why would I be afraid of getting caught when I’m tied up like this?” I replied impatiently. These two kidnappers seemed like idiots anyway.
Suddenly the scar-faced one's phone rang: “Hey, got it.”
He hung up and called another number: “Zhou Lin Hao, your wife is in our hands, if you want her to live, hand over the new project from Hongbao Group!”
The scar-faced kidnapper approached me: “Say two words.”
“I don’t know what to say,”
“Say anything anyway.”
Sudden and without warning, a slash on my face slapped me with a loud "Ear scratch" and shouted "Old man orders you to say!"
I was stunned, my ears ringing wildly, blood-red specks spouting from my mouth, unable to calm down for hours.
Over the phone, Zhao Linghao's loud voice echoed "Stop it! She didn't say that? I heard her!"
Thin bamboo rod suddenly had an epiphany: "Right, bro, she isn't speaking right now."
The slash continued to threaten Zhao Linghao: "If you don't deliver the project by noon tomorrow, we'll leave a note!"
He hung up the phone after that and asked Thin Bamboo Rod to come over and unpack my bag, saying maybe there was something important in it.
Thin Bamboo Rod came over and emptied out everything in my bag, but all they found were a pair of socks and a signature photo of Lin Wuhe.
"You how did you get this photo?" Thin Bamboo Rod asked me.
"I guess I was poor and thought to sell them,"
He didn't wait for me to respond again and said "Can I have it? Wuhe is my goddess."
I: "You take it away."I：？？?
Not long after that, a thin bamboo pole brought me water back. I drank some water and chatted with a bandit named Huqian for a while, then used a phone attached to the thin bamboo pole to watch a Korean drama for over an hour.
After watching, I felt tired and wanted to watch a sweet Korean drama. To make it easy for me, the thin bamboo pole was very considerate and downloaded a Korean TV show onto my phone.
Although those two bandits had relaxed their vigilance towards me, they still hadn't untied my hands and feet. So I couldn't take the initiative either.
The scarred one kept muttering about Zhao Linbao how he didn't come yet. The thin bamboo pole was worried sick about me, fearing that I would be abandoned by the boss.
This is my first experience with being kidnapped, although I have felt exhausted physically and mentally, but without any distress. Who knows if those bandits will get angry again?
The whole night, the two bandits took turns guarding me. I planned to sleep but suddenly woke up due to some noise, no matter how hard I tried to close my eyes, I couldn't fall asleep because of exhaustion. After a while, my eyes fell asleep and I drifted off to sleep.
I was startled awake by a loud noise and opened my eyes to see someone shouting with a megaphone: "People inside the warehouse, you're all surrounded! Put down your weapons and surrender!"
What? The police have arrived?
The thin bamboo pole jumped up in surprise: "Brother, what should we do now?"
The scarred one looked at me seriously. I immediately explained: "I haven't called the police, they've been keeping an eye on me all along."
Just then, two police officers kicked open the warehouse door with a loud bang.
Those bandits saw this and realized their situation was hopeless so they threw up their hands and surrendered.
Zhao Linbao surprisingly walked out of the entrance: "Rainy, how are you? Do your wounds hurt?"
I flexed my wrist: "I'm fine."
The thin bamboo pole looked at Zhao Linbao with a scowl: "Fart, die ugly man!"
As I was being thrown into the police car, the thin bamboo pole still tried to warn me: "Big sister, listen to me for once. Don't come back! This kind of guy don't deserve you at all."
I wiped away tears and said: "Off, definitely off."
Later, I went to make a statement again, struggling until nearly noon before returning home.
I asked the boss how they knew where I was:
"We tracked down the phone that hadn't been turned off. Those two seem to be not very experienced."
I thought back: Yeah, I guess so.
When I heard about my kidnapping, my grandma rushed over in an emergency and my little brother was crying and whining about coming too.
My grandma said I must have suffered a lot of emotional trauma from being kidnapped. We need you to see a psychologist.
There's no use; Zhao Linbao had to bring me to the XX hospital.
The psychologist's name is Wu, he's in his 30s, handsome, and looks like a gentleman.
"Zhao, even though I might ask some painful questions but don't be afraid. Everything has passed now."
This doctor is so handsome that I can’t help myself!
"Can you tell me what happened during the time you were kidnapped?"
"We just watched comedy shows together, mostly we talked and got along well."He looked at me with a look of surprise: "Are you watching TV together... and talking? What were you talking about?"
I glanced discreetly at Zhao Lin Hao sitting next to me, afraid to speak.
"Don't worry, Zhao wife won't be worried, it's only if I say it that I can comfort you," Dr. Wu said in a soothing tone, "Believe me, you'll open up your heart."
Zhao Lin Hao also agreed: "Rainy, say!"
I swore that this was the first time the CEO had spoken to me so warmly.
"If I say it, don't blame me,"
"Okay!" The CEO cut him off bluntly.
And so I recounted the conversation to Zhao Lin Hao's surroundings, the air pressure dropping lower and lower.
I saw it wasn't going well and immediately reminded him: "You said you wouldn't blame me!"
He was still furious, so he turned his head away from me.
"The way you use your unhappy marriage to sympathize with robbers," Dr. Wu said with a quiver in his voice, "That's a terrible thing."
"I don't understand what you mean," I thought of all the cruel things Zhao Lin Hao had done to me and my heart was blocked.
"Who says I don't understand?" Dr. Wu suddenly looked teary-eyed: "I understand, I really do! I'm feeling very miserable right now."
Hmm? What's going on?
"What's wrong with you?" 
He fell onto two rows of tears: "If you're willing to tell me about your unhappy marriage, I won't lie to you or be afraid that you'll laugh at me. It was only an hour ago when I discovered my wife cheated on me with my best friend, and I said my son looks nothing like me - ugly, with a scowl, where is my handsome face? Everyone says doctors shouldn't bring emotions to work, but the truth is, if you can cry, it means you care. You mustn't abandon me, please don't leave me later and complain to me."
I saw Dr. Wu crying with his hands over his nose, smiling at me reassuringly: "Don't cry anymore, I won't report you to anyone."
He blew his nose and wiped away his tears: "We're all wandering souls, Zhao wife, I think the two robbers were right - you should leave him as soon as possible."
Zhao Lin Hao heard this and coldly said: "I don't care if you leave or not. As long as you work well, don't try to be a doctor anymore."
I comforted him: "Don't be angry with him, he's crying too much. Let him cry for once."
And then I told Dr. Wu: "You shouldn't think about those sad things. There's a saying - 'To live is to wear green.' You need to adjust your attitude and be a real man. Life is all just fleeting clouds and shadows. One day everything will pass."
Dr. Wu looked at me with teary eyes, shaking his head: "Zhao wife, you're right. I'll make it up soon."
I made a fist: "Let's do it together!"
Zhao Lin Hao glared at me with a line of black: "You came to see a psychologist, not a friend... But I think he needs help too. Let's go out."
The CEO took my hand and was about to walk away when Dr. Wu called out to me.
I pulled out my phone and saw the news on my feed:
"Most clever woman in the world: talking to kidnappers while they hold her captive, it ends well"
7:25 AM this morning, the police in Y City broke the case of the kidnapping, two robbers were arrested safely, and the kidnapped person was rescued. It is understood that during the kidnapping, the kidnapped person talked to the robbers, making them relax, allowing for a successful rescue.
Then there's a video.
Reporter: "You said you had an emotional conversation with the hostage. Can you explain what happened?"
....If previously translated content is also given, use it as reference.
打了马赛克的瘦竹竿：「That big sister is genuine, we just fool around together and then I'll go find her to become siblings after I'm out of here.\"
Reporter：「Why do you want to call her your sibling? Did she bring any emotional turmoil into your life?\"
Swan pipe：「Ah, my life hasn't been going well, the happiest time for me is when we watch comedy shows together. I just want to hold onto that short-lived happiness.\"
After this kidnapping incident, I'm too afraid to go out for a week, fearing revenge.
When browsing videos, I saw a kid eating no flower fruit, which is made from bamboo sticks thread by thread as a childhood snack. The little boy's eyes widened and he got angry, saying he wants it, so I just comforted him and promised to get him some. 
What do I do? Can't go out, not even with dried apricot either. I can only pretend that the kid is sleepy.
I carefully peel oranges one by one, focused on picking out the middle white thread.
My actions made Zhao Lin Hong's face full of contempt.
But what can I do? The little boy wants no flower fruit, so I have to lie to him.
I continue working carefully with my hands, and then Zhao Lin Hong suddenly said his mom called earlier, saying she wanted to meet us.
A cruel old woman logged on, seeing an opportunity to take advantage of the situation.
I thought for a moment that maybe she's going to force me to leave Zhao Lin Hong again, and then get that thousand-dollar eight-hundred-million yuan I'm owed.
This is unbearable!
We arrived at a high-end coffee shop, and as soon as we walked in, there was a woman sitting by the window, looking elegant and refined.
That must be her.
I sat down with Zhao Lin Hong across from her.
「Mom.\" This voice I called out was extremely unnatural.
「Who's calling 'mom' here? I refuse you to marry into my family!\" She looked at me with an extremely displeased expression.
I changed it to 「Auntie.\"
That way it sounds more comfortable.
「Mom, don't be like that.\" Zhao Lin Hong said.
The queen of the empire raised her cup and took a small sip, „Qin Rui Yan, you know, I have always opposed you marrying into our Zhao family.\"
「I know, I know. How could I ever agree to this?\" You think I'd willingly marry someone like that?
She suddenly got angry, slapping the table with her hand, 「You knew all along, and yet you went ahead with it! Don't say you're a woman who's deeply strategic!\"
Deeply strategic? Me?
「Hey, Auntie, what are you talking about? Who's being strategic here?!\" I couldn't take it anymore!
She looked surprised that I would react like this, and then pointed at me again, 「You're saying what? As the daughter-in-law, you dare to speak like this?! Zhao Lin Hong, look at the woman you married!\"
This situation seems to be in my favor, maybe I can use this argument to get out of the marriage.
When I was thinking about how to argue without losing my temper, I suddenly noticed the coffee in front of her.
Bad luck, according to experience, she's going to pour it all over me soon!
Here is the translated content for reference:

If you want me to translate something else, just let me know.「秦雨薇！你…」 She was already so angry that her body started to tremble, and she should have been trying to pour herself a cup of coffee.
I grabbed the coffee pot with lightning speed and poured it all down my throat.
*gulp*gulp*
« Qin Yuwei, what are you doing? » Zhao Linuo stared at me in confusion after I suddenly snatched the coffee from her hands.
« I'm thirsty... », I stammered.
His mom was about to explode: « Qin Yuwei, you're just a shameless woman who can't even match up with my son Zhao Linuo! »
 Wait, there's still cake on the table! Maybe she'll slap me right in the face with it soon?)
I grabbed the perfect moment again and snatched the cake from the table, eating it all by itself.
« Qin Yuwei, what are you doing now? », Boss Zhao asked me again.
« I'm hungry. »
Boss Zhao's mom waved her hand: « Okay, let's not say anything more. I can't even hold you right now, so just leave and get married to my son already! »
« Fine. », I pointed at her Chanel bag, « Is there a divorce agreement in here? I'll sign it right now! »
She looked surprised for a moment and said: « If you're that willing, I won't argue anymore either. »
She pulled out a file from the bag with the divorce agreement papers. I carefully checked them and was amazed to see that if we got divorced, I could get one million in alimony!
I signed it immediately, no hesitation whatsoever.
« Do you have a pen? », I asked.
 « Mom didn't take one either! »
She looked stunned: « I didn't expect you to be so quick... »
I turned back to Zhao Linuo and asked: « Does your public bag have a pen? Can I borrow it for a minute? »
« Qin Yuwei, ... », he had an icy gaze, a cold expression, « I haven't thought it through yet. Don't divorce me! »
Mom was more confused than me: « Isn't Zhao Linuo always saying he wants to leave you? »
Zhao Linuo put the papers back in the bag and walked out of the room with me, holding my hand tightly.
« Why are you doing this?! », I tried to struggle free from his grip, but his hands were like iron claws!
I looked back at her through the glass window, seeing her eyes rolling toward me as if she was about to throw a knife at me.
We finally reached the car door. Zhao Linuo finally let go of my hand.
I rubbed my sore wrist: « What's wrong with you?! You said you were always going to leave me! »,
« I have to initiate it first, don't do it before me! »
« Fine. Let's sign the papers already! », I was so eager that I dragged him back into the coffee shop.
« Qin Yuwei! », he shouted angrily at me, turned around and walked away from the car...I stood still for half an hour, Zhao Lin hadn't come back to pick me up yet, so I found a nearby bus station and sat down.
Evening, summer originally should be beautiful but today's sky is dark and gray with swallows flying low, the atmosphere feels oppressive, looking like it was going to rain.
My stomach started to rumble, I bought some stinky tofu from a street vendor to eat while waiting."
It really wasn't going to rain, just a little bit after all. The rain came pouring down heavily, the sky looked like a hole had been punched through it.
I didn't feel sad at all, I didn't need this kind of environment to create a melancholic mood.
I was eating well when Zhao Lin arrived in his car.
I was stunned, my feelings changed so quickly).
「Just get in the car already!」
I nodded, holding up the stinky tofu in the back seat.
He frowned at me：「Are you eating this on my car?」
「I'll finish it before I come back.\" I said, about to open the door when he stopped me: „Don't get out, just eat here。」
Then he rolled down the window, letting the smell spread around.
The rain hit the windshield, sending droplets of water cascading down. The air was filled with a strong earthy scent all over the city.
The president leaned in close to me, his breath was so close that I could feel it. 
I felt anxious: „What's going on?``
He laughed: „Just buckle up for you!``
This was too much for me, I couldn't handle it: „I'll do it myself, I'll do it myself.\"
「Come on, just eat it and I'll drive.``
I insisted: „No way, this is no big deal. You don't have to bother.``
He wouldn't let up: „Don't be like that, just eat!``
I was fighting with him over the seatbelt, one hand holding the stinky tofu and only able to free up the other hand to block him.
He leaned in closer and closer until I panicked and pushed his head away. 
The stinky tofu dripped all over him, a plastic bowl lid landed on top of his hair, a big glob of sauce ran down to the back of his neck like a little piggy Peppa. 
The sauce splashed up to his lips and he instinctively licked it off.
I: „Is this super delicious?``
He pulled off the bowl lid from his head, gritted his teeth: „Quin, Rain, Si!“
「I told you I'd do it myself...」 I pouted my lips and said, „Your hair looks longer than before, Peppa even has long hair now.\"

After going back, I originally wanted to mention my divorce, but Zhao Liang Hao never responded to me, and it seems like he doesn't agree to it.
He doesn't agree to the divorce, and the divorce contract is ruined. I'm helpless, when can I get both freedom and a large amount of alimony money?
I'm stressed about these things while watching an animated movie with Xiao Cheng, and suddenly Cold Spring sent me a WeChat message: Rainy, Little Seven is dead, I'm so sad, will you come with me? 
Me: Who is Little Seven?
Cold Spring: I left you after being too painful…. [starts crying]
Me: Is it your adopted child?
Cold Spring: No, no, my son is much better than my son!
I am shocked and didn't expect Cold Spring to have an adopted child; he should be very sad right now.
I pick up my bag and get ready to leave, Zhao Liang Hao asks me what's going on, I tell him about Cold Spring's situation, and I also add that I'm worried he might lose it, so let's go with him.
Zhao Liang Hao says whatever he wants will follow me, just before we leave, he tells Lee Ma to take good care of Xiao Cheng, and then rushes off to get the car key.
Driving out of the villa, Cold Spring still hasn't sent us a location message; I have to call him to ask, he says he's in the 123 Building, but the signal is bad, and he can't pinpoint exactly where he is. 
So we take the direction to the 123 Building).
The 123 Building is located in the center of the square, surrounded by a bustling commercial street.
I thought Cold Spring would be there to pick us up, but I don't see him anywhere; I have to call him again, and he says he's behind the building.
Me and Zhao Liang Hao have to get out of the car and walk around to the back of the building, and we find a pet hospital…. 
Cold Spring sees me and rushes over to grab my hand: "Oh no, oh no... Rainy, I'm so sad."
Me: Don't be too sad...
Cold Spring: Zhao Liang Hao never lets me see you; he said you were kidnapped, and I only got anxious.
What is this? Why hasn't Cold Spring contacted me in so many days?
Zhao Liang Hao quickly changes the subject to ask Cold Spring: Is your son?
Cold Spring wipes away tears: "One adorable golden retriever. You'll love it after seeing him."
He says that right before dragging me into the hospital, "You can be sure Little Seven will like it."
He insists on taking me to see Little Seven.
Zhao Liang Hao tries to separate us, saying his son is not human.
Cold Spring gets upset: "My son is not human! 
Me: My son is also not human...
Cold Spring: Oh, my son... [starts crying]
Just then, a veterinarian approaches him: "Cold Spring, you need to go see your dog now."
"Go, I'm going." Cold Spring says and walks with the veterinarian.
Me and Zhao Liang Hao face each other, looking increasingly frustrated; I joke that the feelings of humans and pets are not much different from those of real parents and children. 
I finally realize that there are many people in this pet hospital bringing all sorts of pets to be treated.If previously translated content is also given, use it as reference.

A cat and dog don't matter, there's even sheep, mice, and pigs like that.
Anyway, that fat pig looks like it might weigh around 200 pounds.
I told Zhao Lianguo, "Look at this pig, if it's in the Lianhua Village, it's probably going to be slaughtered for dinner."
I don't know if the pig understood me, so suddenly it snarled and made a loud noise.
Zhao Lianguo turned his back on me and was watching where Cold Xing went, reminding me, "Qin Yuyi, don't bother it, remember what happened last time? If you get too close, it'll buck you off."
Domestic pigs shouldn't be as wild as feral pigs.
To tell the truth, I'm still a bit scared, and I subtly moved closer to Zhao Lianguo's side, but I was still staring at the pig, which suddenly charged towards me like it had lost its mind.
The owner reacted quickly, trying to grab the pig's tail, but ended up getting nothing.
My heart was racing as I watched the pig run past me, and I quickly ducked out of the way.
I'm glad that got over without incident.
After I calmed down a bit, I looked around again, then my eyes landed on something unexpected.
Boss is here?
I turned my head to look, and that pig was trotting towards the boss with incredible speed!
"Qin Yuyi!" the boss called out to me, trying to get down from the pig's back.
Although he's a tall guy, this time he seemed completely unable to control himself because of the fast-moving pig.
Hehehe,
The boss was riding on the pig's back and trying to catch his breath, already having gone around that floor twice.
I quickly chased after the pig's tail and tried to pull Zhao Lianguo down.
By now, people on the street were laughing hysterically.
"Zhao Lianguo! Wait up!" I couldn't believe how fast this pig was running, trying again and again but failing to catch hold of his hand.
"Can't stop it!"
"You can't grab its ears; that'll hurt it and make it run even faster!"
I heard the commotion and saw the veterinarians approaching, only to back off when they saw how wild the pig was being.
I quickly ran up behind Zhao Lianguo's feet and pressed down on his hat.
It was so silly that if his hat fell off, I'd laugh out loud!
That's when it hit me – we looked like a ridiculous pair: one guy trying to control a speeding pig, and another woman desperately trying to keep him steady on the ground.
"Zhao Lianguo! You lost your shoe!" I shouted while running alongside him.
"Qin Yuyi, grab its tail!"
"I-I'm not going to! It's too scary!"If previously translated content is also given, use it as reference.

日子如静水流深，眼看就要到七夕了，然而…
suite用朱自清的一句话：热闹是别人的，我什么也没有。I also want a sweet love, I want a cute little dog.
Today, my grandma bought me a pink feather long skirt, telling me to go on a date with our CEO on Valentine's Day, but I don't want to go.
I don't know what the CEO knows about grandma's plan, and I'm afraid to ask if I do, because he will be annoyed and say something like this: "You really like me that much? You really think you can go out with me?"
My heart isn't in it, staring at a bowl of bones on my plate, sitting across from Zhao Yan Hao saying: "You seem upset.".
I pretend I'm not eating because I'm lackluster: "I just don't have an appetite anymore."
"……But you're already on your third bowl!"
-----
His phone rings, and I see a text from Qin Zidian coming in, it looks like he's asking the CEO to go out on Valentine's Day.
Ah, what a fool I am? Letting Qin Zidian go out with the CEO on Valentine's Day, I won't have to go with him anymore!
Ha ha, I'm a genius.
"Qin Yavi."
"I know you're going to say something, I'm very open-minded, just go, Valentine's Day won't bother me."
"No, it's not that at all, grandma told me to go out with you on Valentine's Day."
"There's no problem, just go with Zidian, if you worry about what grandma will ask later, let's come up with a unified story first."
He falls silent for a moment, thinking, and then says: "Grandma will send someone to spy on us. We have to do this together."
I think my heroine is too flashy, accidentally cutting off the heroine's light, and getting rid of the second heroine.
The streets on Valentine's Day are filled with couples, many shops are using music and sound effects to attract customers, stalls selling small toys, small decorations, and flowers everywhere.
I'm walking with Zhao Yan Hao, just like chasing a dog, he walks ahead, I walk behind, not on the same frequency.
We get to the amusement park, crowded with couples, happy music, and little flower girls, it's very lively.
Zhao Yan Hao raises an eyebrow, finding it too loud, people too many, wants to pay for a private room.
I immediately stop him, this private room is too cold, we're here to enjoy the festive atmosphere.
Just then, a little flower girl walks up to Zhao Yan Hao and asks if he wants to buy some flowers for me. Zhao Yan Hao was about to take out his wallet, but I stopped him: "Little sister, can't you sell just a few flowers to me? I won't spend much money."
The flower girl heard that and her face immediately fell: "Forget it, I don't have enough flowers to sell."
"Why won't you sell me some flowers? It's not going to cost much.".
"I hate this kind of stuff. Whenever I see couples, they always want the guy to buy flowers. Prices are higher than usual, and if he doesn't, they say he doesn't love his girlfriend, using some moral blackmail."
"Can you tell me that?"
"It's only right."
We went around for a bit, bought two ice cream cones, and bought a pair of rabbit ears to wear. I asked the CEO if he dared to take off his hat, but what surprised me was that he actually took it off, and what surprised me even more was that there was no small piggy from Peppa Pig behind his head.
Here is the translated content in English:Boy, his hair grows really fast.
Dai Ruru Zhao Hao has a strange and humorous contrast to his rabbit ears, being both comical and lovable.
「Qin Yue Xi, are you brave enough to go on the roller coaster?」
I lift my head and gaze at the flying roller coaster in the sky, swallow a mouthful of saliva, and say confidently, 「Absolutely, it's just a plate of small dishes!」
The face slap comes too fast!
「Aaaaah! Mommy! I'm scared!」
I tightly grip the handrail, close my eyes, and dare not look down.
「Dai Ruru Zhao Hao, where are you going? Are you on the uphill slope?」
He laughs and says, 「It's just starting now, sitting in the last row is the most intense feeling of zero gravity. You need to get your mind ready!」
I boldly open my eyes, oh wow, it's really high! My legs are so scared that I'm frozen in shock. Is this why they say you have acrophobia? 
The roller coaster has reached its peak, and suddenly all I can hear is the screams of people in front of me and the wind blowing fiercely, making my eyes unable to open. The feeling of zero gravity hits me immediately, and I don't even dare to speak, not to mention feeling a bit nauseous... The long hair of the girl in front of me is blown around by the wind, occasionally hitting my face.
I finally get off the roller coaster, but it takes a while, and when I look up again, I feel terrible, vomiting all over the place. 
「呕——」
Yes, I vomited on the roller coaster. The wind blows so hard that it blows the vomit back to me, covering my face.
I think this roller coaster has been running for a century before we finally reached the end.
I calm myself down and tremble with fear as I take out a handkerchief from my pocket and wipe away the sweat on my face. 
When I finally dare to open my eyes, I see that Zhao Hao is also vomiting, just like me, and his face is covered in dirt.
「Did you really vomit?」
I say, wiping his mouth with a clean handkerchief, 「Go ahead, wipe it off, it's disgusting...」
He looks at me with an expression of complete despair, wipes his mouth thoroughly, and then says, 「Is this my vomit? Is this my vomit? 」
I stare at him with a blank face.
Zhao Hao: „This is definitely your vomit!‟
I look away from his gaze, looking outside the wind that's still blowing fiercely....
Since the wind blew my vomit onto Zhao Hao's face, he got into trouble all day.
「It's getting dark, let's go back home.」
He nods, and suddenly receives a text message from his grandma: I'm waiting for you at home tonight, don't even think about coming back!
I say, «What should we do?» 
Zhao Hao says, „We have to stay in a hotel.‟
「No way, no!」
「Then I'll sleep on the bridge, and you stay in the hotel!‟
「No way, no!」
「Why not, let's book two rooms?!‟
This is my second time staying in a five-star hotel, the last time I was by the sea, and this time I really want to enjoy the hotel service.
Here is the translated content:I'm holding my IC card and looked at it several times, and indeed, even the IC card is designed with a feeling that I don't have enough money to afford a place.
I walked into the luxurious elevator and pressed 15th floor.
I was puzzled, why my IC card and his didn't look the same, later found out that he got himself an apartment suite for the president and gave me an ordinary room.
Ugh, small-hearted ghost!
Mmm—
I wrapped my belly in a tight hug and continuously called out to Zhao Linuo saying I'm hungry.
He finally agreed to take me to eat, but first, he needs to go to the restroom.
After getting Zhao Linuo's permission, I thought in my heart whether to have big mud crab or big giant prawn for dinner.
Cut, kids just do multiple-choice questions, adults should have everything!
I was joyful when thinking about how to torture Zhao Linuo, but the elevator lights suddenly started blinking.
My heart tightened up and said: "Zhao Linuo, the elevator shouldn't malfunction okay?"
"Don't lie, it won't."
He just finished saying that, only heard two beeps, and the elevator suddenly shook violently, I screamed with fear and grabbed onto Zhao Linuo's arm, shouting loudly.
The elevator stopped, Zhao Linuo pressed all the buttons on the elevator then rang the alarm for help.
I was terrified to death, curled up in a ball in the corner, worried that the elevator might crash down.
Zhao Linuo noticed my fear and calmed me down: "You don't have to be scared, do what I say if the elevator is going to fall, you need to stand steady, grab onto your neck with both hands, bend both knees and lift up your feet, touch the wall of the elevator."
I nodded again, checked my phone, no signal as expected, so had to wait anxiously for rescue.
Five minutes went by, ten minutes passed, twenty minutes passed, but still no one came.
I noticed Zhao Linuo's face was getting increasingly painful and asked him: "What's wrong? Are you uncomfortable somewhere?"
"Need to go to the restroom…"
"You can't hold it in anymore?"
I used the phone inside the elevator to call for help again, the worker said that it looked like there were some difficulties so we should wait a bit longer.
I hung up and turned my head and saw Zhao Linuo had already sat down on the ground, crying: 
"Do you want to go pee or crap?"
"You now don't talk to me, I'm really going to pee."
I was frantic, spinning around in circles if he really did pee his pants then that would be too embarrassing for rescue team to see."
"I have some drink bottles with me, can I put one under your butt so you could pee into it?"
Zhao Linuo: "…" 
I finally got a thought: "No way, that's Sprite bottle, the mouth is too small".
Here"You want to pee in my bag...?" I paused for a moment, "No way, you have to go out and let it come out, and there's also your phone and stuff."
Zhou Lan Hao：「……」
I sighed, "You can't even pee sitting down, just hold it with your hand."
Zhou Lan Hao laughed, "You're holding it?"
"I guess I am, my hands are small, but I can try to help you out a bit..." 
Zhou Lan Hao laughed again, "You're holding it?"
I saw him looking like a king who had no interest in anything, so I just kept flipping through the bag to see if there was anything useful.
Oh, selfie stick? Got one!
"I got an idea, you have to pee into this selfie stick and hold the other end of the stick near your drink bottle and use a tube thingy to guide it in."
Zhou Lan Hao, "Forget it, I'm still going to die."
I was still worried, so I kept telling him to take his time, not to strain himself.
He changed positions over and over again because he needed to pee, but I just stood there looking on anxiously。
Then I heard the sound of someone coming, followed by the door being opened, then I finally saw rescue personnel's friendly face."
We were rescued later, Zhou Lan Hao still pretended like everything was fine, shaking hands with everyone he met and thanking them for his help, before quickly running off to the bathroom. 
I checked my phone and looked at the time, and to my surprise, Zhou Lan Hao had been holding it in for an hour.
Zhou Lan Hao finally solved his biological problem, we went to a seafood restaurant, found a seat by the window, I started ordering food like big prawns and small crabs without hesitation.
When I cracked open a crab leg, he looked at the mountain of shrimp shells and crab bones on our table and asked me, "Do you want more?"
I waved my hand, "No, give me some whiskey instead."
"You can drink that? Are you afraid you'll get drunk?"
"I can handle it, I don't worry about it."
But then I got caught.
I stumbled and fell, Zhou Lan Hao grabbed hold of me while I was stumbling around. 
I pushed him away, "Go away, let me go back home." 
"You're looking at you like that tongue is all messed up, listen to me." 
"I'm not, I'm fine, just leave me alone."
"I won't leave you alone."
I started walking forward, my vision got blurry, and I saw a lot of trash bags on the ground. 
Who would throw so many trash bags out here? Not allowed, I need to pick them up.
So I dropped down to pick them up...
How can I carry this? 
"Qin Yu Xi, what are you doing?" Zhou Lan Hao bent down and smiled at me.I shook my head, trying to shake off the gold star that kept flying in front of me: "I'm picking up some face!"
「……That's a red line."
A red line? I refocused my eyes and really was a red line!
Good grief, just lie there as your red line, no big deal, just pretend you're doing some face work?
I stumbled forward, Zhao Lin Bao walking behind me, following my lead without saying a word.
Oh my god, that guy in front of us is so hot!
I rushed over and grabbed him: "Little bro, don't stand on the street if you're not trying hard enough. If you don't want to work hard, just come back home with me. I'm a rich lady and I pay for my husband's expenses."
I said that and hugged him.
"Uh-oh? What are you doing?""The shop assistant scolded me.
Zhao Lin Bao rushed up to intervene: "She was drunk and didn't recognize it was a mannequin."
As we walked, because the billboard was too big, I couldn't see the road ahead of me, and I stumbled and fell on my butt. Zhao Lin Bao quickly picked me up: "Rain Yu are you okay? Do you hurt?".
"I'm going to die...."*cough*
"He's bringing me back,"
I was being held by Zhao Lin Bao in his arms, and wherever he looked, there was a crescent moon hanging in the sky, like a smile on the face of the heaven. The night sky was so calm and sparse stars sparkled.
Zhao Lin Bao brought me back to the hotel room, where there was a big window that stretched all the way to the ceiling. Looking out, I could almost touch the moon。
"Rain Yu can sleep on my moonlight?"
"Sleep tight,"
So I pulled over the blanket and fell asleep.
I slept through the day and woke up when the sun was already high in the sky. I felt dizzy and turned my head to check my body, but Zhao Lin Bao had just come out of the bathroom wearing a pajama suit: "You thought I was something else, didn't you? Did you think I would do something to take advantage of you while you were drunk?"
"Ah no, not at all." I quickly waved my hands to deny.
The end of our Seven-Star Journey was here.
When we got home, grandma was already there. She smiled and took hold of my hand: "You two have been up for a long time, you must be exhausted. Here's some chicken soup to warm you up."
Chicken soup, medicine.....
I felt embarrassed and shook my head violently, waving my hands repeatedly to refuse.
But she insisted, saying she wanted me to hold her grandchild in my arms before I was old.
I pointed at Zhao Lin Bao with my eyes: hurry up!
He shrugged and smiled: "Okay, okay."
"Rain Yu, come on, it's still steaming hot."赵霆皓's smile froze for an instant.
Nai nai's surprise and excitement were mixed together: "Oh my goodness, really! Ha ha ha, I'm so happy to be a grandma again!" 
She gently touched my tummy: "Grandson, you have to grow up quickly!"
I quietly wiped sweat, this was getting serious.
赵霆皓 went to work, and nai nai asked me to teach her how to shop online, saying she wanted to buy baby supplies for the grandchild. I told her I was just pregnant, no need to rush. Nai nai didn't seem to hear me at all, wearing her old glasses and seriously researching taobao.
Suddenly she thought of something and said to me: "Granddaughter-in-law, in a few days it's Zhao Glaro's birthday, don't forget to get him a gift. Men also need to play along."
Oh no, I almost forgot.
But what kind of gift should I get for him? I was really stuck, because buying gifts was my weakest point. Remembering the last time I screamed like a chicken at the market.
I asked nai nai for advice, but she said I had to decide myself, as it was a gift for our two little mouths' pleasure.
 Ah, this... doesn't count for anything...
I worried all day, hearing that gifts require consideration for the person you're giving them to. Zhao Glaro was really rich, and didn't need anything.
I lay in bed tossing and turning, unable to sleep, until I finally thought of a plan: ask Li Chen.
"Gifts for Zhao Glaro's birthday..." he took a moment to think on the phone, "Ah, recently they're really popular on taobao, wooden blocks, against that, the one you'll buy will make him cry if his girlfriend sees it. It symbolizes their relationship being as strong as steel."
I stared blankly: "You and Zhao Glaro? Our relationship can be as strong as steel?"
"Are you kidding me?" he laughed. "This isn't a good idea at all! Wait for me to think again..." 
 Ah, I was on the verge of forgetting.
But then I thought of something: get him a wooden block that would help him relax while working from home, sitting and moving around wouldn't be good for his health... go to taobao and find one. 
I bought it after two hours on taobao and finally finished writing a birthday card to the seller with a sweet message.
Ha ha, done!
Days turned into days, and Zhao Glaro's birthday arrived, but he seemed completely oblivious that today was his own birthday. I contacted the logistics company to send the package to his workplace.
I was sweating as I wrapped the wooden block, when Zhao Glaro called me on video phone.
"Qin Rainy, did you get me a birthday gift?"
"Is it okay?" 
"You think I'll like it?" he pointed the camera at the gift, "This old person's massage slippers do you think I'll wear?"
"...I thought about you sitting all day at work and not exercising. The wooden block is designed to press your feet while walking around, it might be a bit painful but wouldn't that hello kitty style look cute on you?"
He shouted: "Not even a little bit! And what's with this stupid pillow..."
 I stared straight ahead, oh no, how did I pick this one?
The wooden block had a cartoon panda face on the front, with tears streaming down its face, holding onto its cheeks and saying "Don't forget to wear clothes". 
I picked that one.Although I bought a true emoticon pillow, the item that was actually ordered was a picture of a cat, with "Happy Birthday" written below.
I slumped my shoulders and whispered weakly, "Although you may not believe it, I still want to explain this, it's really not my fault."
He took a deep breath and said, "Do you know what's most embarrassing? I don't even know if it was your order; my secretary just delivered it." 
I fell silent for a moment and said, "...this is a sad story, but it's unexpected to me."
"Have you seen that card from Qin Ruoyi?" The boss was furious, his face covered in spit.
"What's wrong with the card?"
"You look at it,"
Then I saw that the card was indeed beautifully designed, but "Dad wishes you a happy birthday!" was written on it.
"It wasn't me, Zhao Zhanhao, listen to me. I didn't think of this; I'm not your dad! You should change the phrase way so that you can say 'I'm your dad'..."
I hadn't finished saying when he hung up the phone.
I quickly opened the Taobao customer service.
Me: "You sent my order wrong, don't you know? The picture I ordered is a cat, not a panda head!"
Customer Service: Sorry to apologize for that, sir. 
Me: And what about the card? You also wrote it wrong!
Customer Service: There's nothing like that, sir. What you wrote was "Dad wishes you a happy birthday". We think it's just an extra character so we corrected your mistake.
Hmm?
I looked at my order information again with doubts and noticed that the remark was indeed "Dad wishes you a happy birthday".
Pronunciation input method has killed me...
I spent the whole day worrying about whether Zhao Zhanhao would come back to how he could handle it, so maybe now I should go buy another gift? Look at the time; it's too late anyway.
Not long after, I heard the sound of a car, and then Zhao Zhanhao came in.
I carefully glanced at him with slanted eyes and said, "Rat, you look just like the boss."
I said that out loud without thinking before realizing what I had done. "Oh my god! My mouth is going to be killed; I was trying to say 'the boss'..."
He stared at me coldly: "Today's been so annoying with you!"
I sulked and muttered, "It's just that he was being kind too."
On the dinner table, he only picked up his chopsticks twice as if eating, while I munched on ribs loudly. Then he put down his chopsticks and told Lee-ma to make a bowl of porridge.
After drinking the porridge, he seemed to be getting more and more uncomfortable with some gasping noises.
I was originally going to call his private doctor over, but since the doctor is on leave, I asked him if he wanted me to accompany him to the hospital tomorrow.
"Alright, big guy,"
His face turned pale.If previously translated content is also given, use it as reference.
If you have any questions about this content please let me know.
 
「If I had to hurt that badly, I'd put a bandage on.\"
He took over the ice bag：“If you don't sleep with me tonight, no one will take care of me.”
“I'm a big headache!” 
The next day we came back to xx hospital in our car with Zhao Yang Hao. I helped him book an oral surgery appointment.
It wasn't long before it was our turn again, and Zhao Yang Hao lay down on the dental chair.
The doctor turned around and put on new gloves:“Open your mouth.”
Zhao Yang Hao obediently opened his mouth.
“You want to open it bigger? There's a cavity at the tip of your mouth. If you don't open it wider, how am I supposed to operate?” I suggested.
He listened and then opened it a little bit more.
I looked into his mouth：“Big boss man, you really have cavities... but I can barely see them even when you do open your mouth. Can you open it a bit more?”
He hesitated for a moment before listening again. Then suddenly he heard a loud cracking sound.....
Zhao Yang Hao and I froze in shock.
I clenched my fists, trembling with sweat to touch his chin. He screamed as soon as he felt pain from the dental chair and jumped out of it.
“Ugh, doctor! Is your face falling off? That big noise is so scary!”
The doctor was shocked and suddenly turned around without putting on his gloves: “Actually, it wasn't necessary to open it that wide. I'll help you adjust your jaw today.” 
I didn't dare look at Zhao Yang Hao's angry expression. I thought to myself, “Well, that's it. We're done. We wouldn't have had a bad argument if we hadn't come here.”
The doctor adjusted his jaw, and then gave him a mouthguard with instructions to wait until his jaw heals before getting the tooth extracted.
The rest of the way Zhao Yang Hao was calm and quiet, only occasionally making soft noises while driving. 
He started to get some pain from the cavity after wearing the fixed mouthguard. It was an unbearable level of pain that made me tremble with fear, afraid I would faint if I didn't stop thinking about it.
“Zhao Yang Hao, I'm sorry.”
He took a deep breath and relaxed, his face full of acne: “It's fine. Since we've been together, I've had so many injuries. I'm used to it now…”
I didn't expect Zhao Yang Hao to be so strong. He was even willing to come here wearing the mouthguard.
I was trembling with fear all the way to the hot spring resort village. 
The hot spring resort was situated at the top of a half mountain, surrounded by beautiful scenery. The sky was clear blue, and the sun was shining fiercely. Occasionally, I saw some unknown birds flying overhead, casting a long shadow across the ground.
I thought I had only Zhao Yang Hao and myself when we arrived, but then I saw Qin Zhi Huan and Liao Chuan coming towards us, which made me breathe a sigh of relief. Before long, little Xiao Cheng also appeared, telling his driver that he hadn't seen me at home that day, and insisted on coming along.
“You have something in your backpack,” Zhao Yang Hao asked me.
 “Little yellow duckies.” I said with a smile, “Why would we go to hot springs if we don’t? Let's put some little yellow ducks in the water. How cute it will be!”
“Then why did you bring all of them?” Zhao Yang Hao ridiculed me again.
Qin Zhi Huan also laughed along with Zhao Yang Hao:“Sister, we're adults. When we take a bath, we don't need little yellow ducks.”"This isn't a place for kids, after all." I crouched down to feel small程's face and said, "Okay, little程."
Small程 cooperated by nodding.
Qīng chūn lightly swept me over, speaking softly to warn me not to bother Zhao Lán hào, because this hot spring resort was his, and if he got annoyed, I'd be sleeping in the coal shack tonight.
Oh dear... alright, I won't bother him, but I definitely want to soak in the hot springs with小黄鸭.
I quickly ran up to catch up to Zhao Lán hào and asked him where the girl's soup was.
He teased a smile and said we'd share it.
Share?
Fine, anyway, with so many people in one pot... who dares to mess with that?
While I was getting dressed in the dressing room, I put on my swimsuit, only to find it exposed more than last time by the sea. So I had to wrap a towel around myself outside.
I threw小黄鸭 into the soup, which made me realize they were floating half the area. Qīng chūn quickly said, "We should grab one before Zhao Lán hào finishes changing."
Just as we were frantically trying to grab one,霸总 brought 小程 along.
He saw us diving for小黄鸭, raising an eyebrow, and said, "Don't grab it!"
Next, Qín zhēn yàn came over wearing a swimsuit, her skin white and beautiful, with big breasts and a big rear end. Her long legs were covered in stockings, and a pair of white underwear was visible underneath. She walked towards me, making my eyes dizzy.
Cold chūn playfully pulled me off my towel and said, "Rè nǐ zài bù lòu qí xiǎo jiǎo!" (Are you not going to take it off?)
I gave 小程 a swim cap and brought him along to join us in the soup. 小程 was wearing a swim cap, playing with小黄鸭 while everyone else enjoyed the gentle stroking of their skin.
K'k'k'...
I must be hungry again...
Zhao Lán hào smiled and said, "Hungry? What do you want me to get for you?"
"White water-boiled eggs have any?"
Cold chūn also wanted one, and soon 小程 was asking for some as well.
Zhao Lán hào decided to bring someone over with some boiled eggs.
I peeled an egg for 小程 first, then peeled another myself. Just about to eat it when Zhao Lán hào's big hand reached out and took the "游" -shaped small黄鸭 from me.
Hehe, you're worth more than gold!
I had to put down the egg to go get that little yellow duck, but I didn't notice my legs were wobbly. I tripped forward and fell, flailing my arms wildly, when suddenly, my hands landed on something soft and squishy...
Only to hear Zhao Lán hào groaning in pain, with his face contorted in agony.
"What's wrong? Is it broken?" I cried out, worried that I might have hurt him badly.
Qín zhēn yàn rushed over, concerned. "Zhao Lán hào, are you okay? Should we call a doctor?"
"Old brother, this is like being kicked by a chicken!" Cold chūn exclaimed.
Cold chūn and Qīng chūn came over to check on Zhao Lán hào as well. Zhao Yang Hua had finally gathered his courage and spoke his first words to Qin Yu Wei, "You're not really thinking of how bad this is, are you? Come on, let's try it out tonight."
"I don't know..."
"Hey, uncle, your egg has landed on my little duck's back!" Little Cheng pointed at the chicken egg Zhao Yang Hua had dropped, which was now covered in feathers from his duck.
Everyone was silent.
After a warm bath, I asked Zhao Yang Hua if he wanted to go to the nearby clinic, but he flatly refused. 
I thought for a moment and realized that this was my own written novel, with the CEO having a main character aura field, never going to abandon his son. 
 Qin Zhan Yuan kept secretly looking at me, as if looking for an opportunity to talk to me about something. I quickly calculated in my head what would happen if we continued down this path; wouldn't she be unhappy when she found out that the divorce contract had been reduced from a million to a hundred thousand? 
I didn't want to let Qin Zhan Yuan push Zhao Yang Hua, so I could let him make up his mind quickly. After all, she was my white moonlight, and I was just a mosquito sucking blood.
To facilitate conversation, I suggested going to the bathroom together, not expecting her to agree that easily. 
As we walked into the bathroom, we both casually dropped our arms around each other's shoulders without needing to be told.
She blurted out, "Sister, I'm really in love with Zhao Yang Hua. Back then, because his grandma disapproved, I had lost my passion for life and kept going abroad alone. But every day since then has been filled with thoughts of him. You know that you're the one who came later and replaced him, so why don't you just give it to me?" 
Later that became a green tea...
No way no way, I need to calm down.
"I also want to give it to you, actually. I knew Zhao Yang Hua didn't like me from the start, but now that we're at the point of divorce, I thought maybe you could help me warm him up and get him to sign the contract sooner."
She heard this and her eyes lit up immediately, smiling happily.
5.
I was shocked, my mouth full of teeth...
Escape Diary: Please push Zhao Yang Hua away a bit more
After that conversation, my heart finally relaxed, having fantasized about how to spend that million. 
I was happily eating an apple when Cold Chen enthusiastically invited me to go climbing trees. 
Climbing trees, childhood memories! I want to go I want to go!
Cold Chen continued to say he accidentally found a tree that was perfect for climbing and said my climbing style must look beautiful.
Oh... Cold Chen's fan filter is still too strong.
I followed Cold Chen to the location, from far away, we saw an old... leaning tree? The one in front of it had a small pond with flowers blooming. There were also some little ducks floating on the water, occasionally jumping out to catch fish. 
Luckily, I climbed over the rock and climbing trees was easy as pie for me. When I reached the top, my view opened up instantly and I felt an overwhelming sense of freedom in that one moment. The wind blowing through my hair added a refreshing feeling.
The scenery is beautiful... beautiful... big guy, you're making me blush! 
 Zhao Yang Hua appeared again!He said calmly, "You guys are having a lot of fun."
I cursed under my breath, "You came here and you're not having any fun at all."
I sat on a tree branch and asked him, "Are you here to argue with me about who can climb this tree first?"
"Who's rare?"
Chonglan spoke in an unfavorable tone, inserting himself into the conversation, "So what? You play your game, we'll play ours."
Zhaoyan furrowed his eyebrows and didn't bother responding. Instead, he went to look at the pond ahead.
I turned back around and said to Chonglan, "Chonglan, do you believe me that I can hang from this tree branch with both arms and jump up?"
"Rainvi, don't do it, it's too dangerous."
"Okay, I've practiced." Then I hung my arms on the tree branch, doing a single arm movement before using all my strength to lift both legs off the ground. I... kicked the back of the pond in front of me with one foot.
He was first unbalanced and his body leaned forward, flailing his arms wildly in the air, shouting loudly. He tried to protect himself by tying a rope around his jaw, crouching down with his head stretched out and his neck extended, and suddenly splashed into the pond.
His whole body was covered in mud, but his chin above the water remained clean and clear.
I quickly jumped off the tree branch and ran over to him, "Ahahaha, Zhaoyan! I didn't do it on purpose!"
He thrashed about in the water for a while before standing up, "Rainvi!!."
My attention suddenly shifted to his throat. Was he okay? He shouted so loudly earlier.
Chonglan was laughing so hard from the side that he was holding his stomach.
I hurriedly explained, "I didn't notice you were right in front of me when I swung around, and I didn't expect... "
He was determined not to listen to me. He wanted to stand up straight and try to pull himself out of the mud.
Pulling it out... pulling it out... pulling it out...
It looked like he had sunk deeper into the mud.
I peeked out from under my body, trying to grab his hand to help him up, but using all my strength to lift myself up. Zhaoyan didn't budge at all.
Chonglan was laughing too hard and grabbed Zhaoyan's other hand as well, making no difference.
There was nothing we could do, so Chonglan went to find someone to help us.
I sat down on the bank and stared blankly with my eyes fixed on him and Zhaoyan.
Finally, I broke the tension by speaking up, "Eventually, people will come. When they see you like this, how will you feel?"
He let out a cold laugh, "There's no way it could be more embarrassing than what happened last time when I rode a pig onto the front page? Of course not!"
I: ".."
Chonglan quickly returned with several burly men and also brought Qin Zidian behind them.
Qin Zidian was frantically rushing forward, "Zhaoyan, are you okay? Did you get hurt?"
One of the big guys tossed a rope at Zhaoyan's waist and said, "Boss, tie this rope around your waist so we can pull you out."
Zhaoyan did as he was told, followed by several men chanting "One-two! One-two! One-two!"Finally, the CEO emerged from the pond, with his entire body a deep black, like a black statue on the sidewalk.
Zhang Zhanhao looked at me one last time before leaving, and I shuddered, rushing after him. "CEO, listen to me, I swear I didn't do it intentionally... even though you're so dirty, you still have that explosive charm, haha..."
After following him back, I couldn't face him for the rest of the day, fearing he would scold me if I dared approach him. So I bought a ticket and left behind with my backpack.
Zhang Zhanhao's eyes spotted me again, asking where I was headed.
I smoothed out my backpack strap, turning around to look at him with a scowl. "I got angry with you today, so I'm going out to look for food now."
He smiled. "Who says I won't give you food?"
I hung my head. "It's just that... "
He sighed. "Do you think I'm so scary in your eyes?"
Before I could respond, he said, "I want to go with you."
I naturally refused, but he insisted. We wouldn't have been comfortable traveling together anyway.
"I don't want to sit in your small car today; I'm dizzy," I lied.
Like someone of his status, he shouldn't be willing to squeeze into a public bus.
"Okay, do what you want."
He got up from the car and followed me to the bus station.
As we waited for the bus, "You're so used to riding luxury cars, how are you adapting to this?" he teased.
"I'm experiencing the hardships of the people," I replied with a smile, but my tone was sarcastic.
Ugh, it's all just a show. I couldn't even bear to look at him.
The bus arrived soon enough, and I said, "I didn't prepare any money for you; if you don't have any, go back."
I threw two coins into the fare box, but Zhang Zhanhao pulled out a 100-rupee note from his wallet and handed it to the driver. The driver was taken aback.
How wasteful of him! That amount could have paid for two rides.
I cursed under my breath that I would rather throw the money into the coin box than give it to Zhang Zhanhao.
The bus had no seats, so we stood there.
In the distance, I heard two girls whispering to each other. "There's a guy with a chin strap on, should we let him sit?"
"Looks like he's in pain; let him."
But then Zhang Zhanhao said, "I'm not in pain; you can all sit."
The girls were shocked and blushed.
I hit him with my elbow. "You're still causing trouble with your face!"
He muttered under his breath, "It's all because of me..."
I interrupted him. "By the way, I still haven't stopped you from causing harm to others. And while we're at it, why don't you get your ex-wife to bring that separation agreement so we can finalize our divorce? We've been dragging it out for too long; just sign it already."
But Zhang Zhanhao's expression darkened when he heard this. "I'm fine now, I don't need your freedom."
"You'd rather keep me waiting? Men, cheating on their wives is irresponsible behavior if you really like someone else. If you truly want to be with her, just get a divorce from me first!"
He scoffed. "I'm not interested in leaving you for her."
"You're willing to let her wait while we're still together? That's unfair. If you can't make up your mind, then just leave us alone."「 Qin Ruyi, I've never seen a wife as elegant as you, you just…」
He said it just as he arrived here, and suddenly the driver brother let out a loud honk, swerved hard to avoid an accident, and I lost my balance leaning forward in shock.
My hand grabbed onto something soft and fluffy... Whatever, I'll stabilize my body first, then deal with that later, so I grabbed onto it... Wait, why am I still going forward?!
I looked straight ahead just about to touch the ground, when Zhao Linbao stretched out his arms to grab me by the waist and hold me steady.
I felt so close to the ground, only a finger's width away, when I tapped my chest in relief that it was all over.
What is this? 
I focused my eyes on what I had grabbed onto... Wait, did I pick up someone else's wig?!?
I turned my head to look at the man sitting next to me, who glared at me with anger in his eyes, and his balding head looked pale under the bright sunlight, making me dizzy.
I apologized hurriedly: "Brother, sorry! It wasn't intentional. You don't have to be mad. I'll help you put it on."
So I frantically helped him put the wig back on, "Oh no, wrong way... didn't get it right at all. Brother, don't hurry. Just give me a minute..."
Just then, other passengers in the bus couldn't help but stifle their giggles as they mouthed "what's going on?" 
I grew more and more anxious, this is ridiculous! How do I put it on? No, that won't work... When I was stuck, Zhao Linbao just smiled quietly from the side, holding back his laughter.
I worried that brother would lose control of his temper, when all I wanted to say was something to calm him down, but instead I blurted out: "Your head is really shiny and cool. And your hair products are smooth too. What kind do you use?"
The entire bus fell silent as everyone laughed, the driver brother even chuckled while driving, holding back his anger.
The balding man glared at me with his eyes still narrowed but began to calm down: "Don't worry, I won't hit you... Maybe next time you can sit in front of my wife and help her find a seat. She seems like she has balance issues." 
I remained speechless.... 
I wiped away sweat, that bus ride was indeed terrifying!
Finally, we arrived at the stop, and I couldn't wait to get off.
"Let's walk across the bridge." 
"No, there are traffic lights everywhere. Walking across is so tiring." 
I scowled: "There's a crosswalk, and it's not that far either." 
He didn't argue anymore and followed me behind."
Just a few steps away from stepping onto the bridge, I stopped and asked him, "Are you sure you can make it?"
Here is the rest of the translated content.If previously translated content is also given, use it as reference.

"This is very dangerous, maybe it's better not to."
"I told him to stick his tongue out a little," I said with a smirk. "You're afraid of me, but I'm brave."
"That's just a joke from when I was younger," I thought, so I continued to taunt the CEO with my eyes while pretending to push my leg up and kick it over.
Suddenly something flashed past my eyes, and my legs knocked into something, causing me to sit down hard on my butt. Out of habit, my body leaned back in a reflexive motion, and I grabbed onto the iron pillar below my seat for support as the scenery around us blurred by rapidly.
I finally came to, wondering how I ended up sitting on someone's bike. A student in a school uniform was riding his bike ahead of me, wearing earbuds and whistling a tune without even realizing I was sitting on him.
I gently tapped his shoulder, trying to get his attention. "Classmate, can you please put me down?"
He startled and slammed on the brakes, taking off his earbuds and turning around at me with a look of surprise. "Hey! When did the princess from heaven fall from the sky?"
Looking at him, I realized he was probably in high school. He had a small complexion with wheat-colored skin, thick eyebrows, and big eyes that made him very handsome.
"Sorry about that," I said. "I wasn't paying attention when I crossed the bridge earlier."
He remembered, and his face lit up as he exclaimed, "I knew it! You seemed to have pressed my seat too hard, and I thought you had crashed into the brakes."
I looked back at the CEO, who was still standing on the bridge watching me with a gust of wind blowing through his hair. He had an untidy appearance.
I got off the bike, and the school student said he could give me a ride. I agreed, and we exchanged WeChat numbers.
It turned out his name was Li Ming Morning, which wasn't too bad.
"You're not going to buy snacks for tomorrow night, are you? If I don't bring you food, you'll be hungry all night." Zhao Lin Ao said in a cold tone, making the air pressure around us feel off again.
I bought an entire box of instant noodles and brought it back home anyway.
Zhao Lin Ao still insisted that I shouldn't eat too much bubble tea, but I found his attitude to be increasingly bossy and annoying.
At dinner, Zhao Lin Ao even gave me a full bowl. Before I finished my first serving, Qin Zhi Wan had already pushed her food around her plate and said, "Oh no, I'm so full."
I couldn't eat anymore because of the discomfort in my stomach, so I added a second bowl of noodles.
Zhao Lin Ao promised to give me a larger portion next time. 
After dinner, Cold Chuan suggested playing two games of King's Glory right after I was excitedly online. However, when I logged on, I found that they had already started the game and were mocking me.
Just as I was getting upset, it was 10 PM, and I washed my face and went to bed. Qin Zhi Wan came knocking on my door again, but this time she looked pale and weak, holding onto the wall for support, with a shaky voice saying, "Rain Vei, can you bring me some instant noodles? I'm starving."
I:「……"
Just as Qin Zhi Wan was slurping noodles and kicking her legs out, Zhao Lin Ao arrived.
Qin Zhi Wan's expression turned stiff, and she spoke slowly, trying to hide it with a fake smile. "How come you're still full again?"
I:「……”Zhao Linhao asked me for nail clippers, I was sitting on the bed playing happy dissension, and didn't have the time to give him one, so I just told him to command him to go get mine from my makeup bag.
He looked through it for a bit before picking up the clippers and leaving.
The CEO's feet were about to step out, when Qin Zihang immediately continued slurping down noodles.
The goddess wasn't very good at this.
After drinking two sips of soup, she belched ~, then happily walked away, reminding me that my eyebrows need to be fixed.
I looked in the mirror and didn't see anything wrong with it.
So I opened up my makeup bag, looking left and right but couldn't find the eyebrow clip. Maybe Zhao Linhao took it earlier anyway, he wouldn't have used it for anything but still, I'll go ask him about it.
I knocked on the door and soon the person who came in was cold Xian.
"Rain Vei are you coming to spend a good night with Zhao Linhao or can you stop doing that?",
I clapped on his shoulder: "You thought too much."
My eyes looked over him, seeing Zhao Linhao staring at himself in the mirror.
What is he doing?
I was confused and walked up to take a look, then I felt an unprecedented anger, he was the CEO of a big corporation, but he took my eyebrow clip and used it as a nose clip!
I angrily took back my eyebrow clip from him, and also picked up the nail clippers.
It's too infuriating!
My eyebrow clip is dirty……
I secretly clenched fists, this revenge won't come from you!
I checked the timing and estimated that he should be taking a bath now, but for extra safety I still called him on the phone, no one answered, it was indeed in the shower.
I quietly slipped into his room, hearing the sound of water splashing in the bathroom, my heart was racing as I looked around the room, finally finding the eyebrow clip on his bedside table.
You used my eyebrow clip for your nose, then I'll use your razor to shave my armpit!
I quickly went back home and shaved my armpit with his razor, then quietly snuck back into his room and put the razor back in its original place.
—
I lay down on the bed, feeling relieved but soon fell asleep due to exhaustion.
The next morning I woke up very early and sent a delivery service to bring him lunch. When he was brushing his teeth, I placed the food on his desk and cold Xian walked in, saying that his razor wasn't working so he wanted to borrow mine.
Zhao Linhao thought for a moment before refusing.
"Ah, don't worry, I won't give you any diseases."
Zhao Linhao hesitated for a moment: "You can have it."
I was in a deep conflict whether or not to tell cold Xian that the razor I used earlier was shaved with my armpit hair.
Cold Xian just wanted to use it, when he saw the thing again, his eyes suddenly became serious and put it back in its original place. Zhao Linhao came out of the bathroom at exactly the same time as this scene unfolded: "Why aren't you using it?"Qin burst out after half a day, finally saying: "You know, your razor has never been properly cleaned... Zhao Lin Hao, I didn't think you'd be so entertaining."
I took advantage of the emperor's wrath not yet having passed, and hastily ran out, only to hear him roar: "Quin, Rain, Vi -."
Life as a chicken and dog may have seemed to fly by too quickly, with autumn arriving in the blink of an eye. The vast sky was now dotted with migratory birds, and the fallen leaves from the wisteria trees blanketed the sidewalk in a layer of golden brown.
This city was devoid of most flowers, trees, and grasses, which only reflected the changing seasons. Despite the usual stream of cars on the asphalt road, it remained unchanged at night, when the streets were still lined with bright lights.
I sighed wistfully at the fleeting nature of time, while also researching how to create a fake belly for myself. I had no idea if my stomach would swell after two and a half months of pregnancy.
Zhao Lin Hao called me over, telling me to hurry up. Oh, he forgot to mention that after his jaw healed, he went to the hospital for check-ups and found out that the cavity tooth was too far gone to be left in, so it was ground down. He said I'd have to accompany him next to get a dental implant.
I sat in the passenger seat, browsing on Taobao without much enthusiasm, when Zhao Lin Hao asked me: "What are you looking at?".
"Is there a fake belly somewhere? Maybe I can buy one and stuff it into my stomach,"
"I have an idea."
I urgently asked him: "What's your plan?"
"Let's really have a baby!"
"Get out of here!"
It didn't take long to arrive at the hospital, where Zhao Lin Hao walked in with ease, looking for a doctor. I joked that he usually used private doctors, but I never expected him to adapt so well to the hospital.
The doctor told us to wait a minute while he went to get something, and then brought out his dental tools. I was curious about how the artificial tooth looked, and I leaned over my shoulder to take a peek, but Zhao Lin Hao refused, saying he didn't want me to see his mouth again because of his loose jaw.
The doctor sat back down, and I asked him if he could take a look at my teeth. But then he said: "Only if you open your mouth."
I opened my mouth, but before the doctor could do anything, Zhao Lin Hao exclaimed, pointing at me, saying: "Qin Rain Vi, are you tricking kids with medicine?".
The entire medical staff couldn't help but burst out laughing.
The doctor looked over and said: "Your teeth are really good. No cavities whatsoever."
I was ecstatic, realizing that I wouldn't have to go through what Zhao Lin Hao had endured like that if I hadn't lied about my pregnancy.
As the doctor continued working on the artificial tooth, his phone suddenly rang, and he answered it while holding out the tooth for Zhao Lin Hao. Before I knew it, the sound of a tooth falling onto the floor echoed through the room. I immediately dropped to my knees, frantically searching under the chair for it, knowing that if the emperor found out, he'd surely kill me.
I was about to crawl all the way to the back of the chair when suddenly I heard the voice from above: "What are you doing?!"I froze, quietly wiping my sweat, "I, we're... uh, searching for teeth everywhere..."
So I searched for that fake tooth under the boss's intense gaze, which was dripping with sweat.
Since the boss got his fake tooth fixed, I would often tease him, deliberately making a scene in front of him about eating chicken bones and claws, and he didn't even mind it anymore. But I felt like I wasn't funny at all.
The next morning, my sister Liu sent me a message on WeChat, saying she was very upset, tomorrow was the half-term exam's first parent-teacher conference, but she was too afraid to tell our parents because her grades were terrible.
Liu: Sister, can you pretend to be me and go to the parent-teacher conference?
I thought for a moment, it was quite exciting.
So I replied: Two minutes, I need your detailed information.
Liu sent me a message, she was 13, in high school grade 6 (class 6), her grades were the best once, which made her progress by one position, and she was ranked second-to-last...
I told her to go see if she would get criticized by the teacher.
Liu: Rainy sister, help me out... Actually, I had a secret, so I didn't tell dad and mom.
I: What's it?
Liu: Early romance. With our class first position...
This job is on my shoulders!
The next day.
"Hey, this is your parent-teacher conference, you're still pretty young."
Next to me, the class president joked.
Liu was blushing and scratched her forehead back and forth: "That's my sister."
The class president was a middle-aged woman with an authoritative demeanor.
"You're good, good," she said, shaking hands with me. "What's your family name?"
"My surname is Qin,"
She looked confused. "Are you that morning's parent-teacher conference sister?"
I jumped in surprise, will she find out something? I had to calm down: "Yes, what's wrong?"
"There's a problem with your last name."
Liu blushed red when she heard this. I was thinking of my heart, I quickly replied:
"I'm adopted by mom, that's why my surname is different from dad."
At the parent-teacher conference, because Liu's grades were terrible and he was a notorious troublemaker in class, I got scolded a lot more than usual, just like when I was back in school. Luckily, I had a thick skin.
I thought the criticism was over, but what happened next surprised me. The class president called me to her office after the conference.
It seemed there was another round of criticism waiting for me.
As soon as I walked out of the classroom, I saw Zhao Zhaolin staring at me!
I asked him only to find out that he had secretly looked at my WeChat conversation with Liu.
How could a top executive like him do such an invasion of privacy? It was too much!
Liu pointed at Zhao and said: "Is this his husband?"
My sister-in-law.My colleague said, "For now, let's not talk about this. Just take me to the office already."
When we arrived at the office, a guy with a thin eyebrow and an expression of being well-behaved was standing there.
He looked like he had been scolded by his teacher and was probably forced to stand there for punishment.
 Another teacher told that guy, "You know who柳一晨's boyfriend was? Go get her over here."
 That guy didn't say anything, just smirked.
 I suggested, "Hey classmate, can you go call that girl over? We want... uh... to meet the future sister-in-law."
 Teacher: " ….?"
 The guy finally spoke up, "I'm him."
 Everyone in the office was stunned. He really caught us off guard!
I excitedly dragged柳一晨 outside, wanting to know all about them together, but Zhao霆皓 and the class captain came out with him.
I quickly changed my attitude, "Lys One Morning! What are you doing? Break up with her now!"
 Class Captain was firm, "He didn't mess me around. We're not breaking up."
 Sister? Oh wow, I felt so empowered to be his sister!
 Zhao霆皓 said, "If you two don't break up, you have to promise not to waste your relationship time on studying and you also need to make progress in your studies. When the time comes, take a university that meets your expectations, see many beautiful scenery, and if you still want to be together after all that, I won't block you."
 The two guys agreed quickly.
 The principal finally arrived, Zhao霆皓 didn't beat around the bush, directly said he was柳一晨's husband and explained his previous statement.
 Principal: "I called you here because this isn't what I wanted."
 "You probably thought you had it all figured out." Zhao霆皓 started spitting venom.
 The principal got caught off guard and couldn't say a word.
 After that,柳一晨 posted a picture of a rainbow on WeChat for 20 minutes. Husband is really cool!
 She thinks she's so lucky to have such an awesome husband!
 I'm not sure what he saw in her, though.
It was already getting dark when we went back home. The sun was setting over the horizon, casting a warm glow over the house. The wind blew, and the sound of leaves rustling filled my ears, making the atmosphere even more peaceful.
 Dinner time arrived, but Zhao霆皓's phone kept buzzing with messages from Qin Zhidai and his mom.
 It seemed like Qin Zhidai had won him over by talking about divorce.
 Zhao霆皓 didn't respond at all.I couldn't take it anymore:"You at least respond to me, or else people think you're dead."
Zao Huao:「……"
I continued saying:"Your mother doesn't like me, I'm still being your daughter-in-law and it's too distant. You also know that the relationship between a father-in-law and a daughter-in-law is the hardest to deal with. My twenty-seven years of practice can't compare to you mom's. Besides, you and Zhi Huan are an odd couple, my watching over you like a hawk isn't suitable, and besides, you've always liked Zhi Huan. I've thought it through, let's divorce."
Zao Huao's face twisted in pain, voice ice cold:"Do you really not like me? Do you really want to get divorced?"
"I do,"I said finishing my sentence, my mind still left with a question why I didn't say I don't like him.
It shouldn't be necessary anyway, I thought. There's no need to say it.
His eyes darkened instantly, lowering his eyelids, saying I should wait for some time so that he can re-write the divorce agreement.
I agreed.
After autumn, my skin feels very dry and my lips are more prone to cracking, again it's time to use body lotion and lip balm.
I washed up and climbed onto bed, officially starting my binge-watching night.
Hmm, tonight is the final episode, I must watch it.
I turned on the light and lay down, looking around feeling drowsy, my phone not very stable. My eyes got tired after a while, just couldn't keep them open anymore and fell asleep.
I was dreaming of something beautiful when my CEO burst into the room with one phone call, waking me up completely.
"Your lip balm is cracked,"he said, wanting to use mine.
I mumbled drowsily:"You can take it, there's a second drawer. Just turn off the light, I don't want you getting headaches."
I hung up the phone and fell back asleep.
He came over after a while, finally found it but couldn't find it anywhere. He kept calling me and was very upset.
I flipped my body around again, reminding him again:"It's in the second drawer."
"Nope,"
I got up with half-closed eyes, rubbing my head while going to the drawer, handing him the lip balm:**"Here, take it."
Who knew that he sat down on one butt and refused to move unless I applied the lip balm.
I rubbed my sleepy eyes again, tears started streaming down my face. He was acting so possessive.
Why bother? I thought.
So I slapped some lip balm onto his lips.
"You're applying it all wrong,"
He made a pouting expression:**"You don't know how to apply lip balm at all. Alright, do it." 
Then he puckered up
"My god! What is this?! This is not lip balm at all!"
My sleepy eyes opened instantly when I felt something solid in my hand. Which one was the lip balm again?
"Ahahahaha! Oh no! Sorry, Zao Huao!"I rushed to turn on the light and saw that his lips were stuck together, still mumbling and trying to move his lips.
I put my ear against his face:**"What did you say? Are you okay?……."
He kept saying something but I couldn't understand what he was saying.
He said something about being sorry and I felt a surge of panic. He wasn't fine at all.
Here is the translated content in English:If previously translated content is also given, use it as reference.

================
He was furious and emotionally charged, saying he wanted me to call his private doctor.
His private doctor arrived quickly, seeing this scene, couldn't help but burst out laughing.
I worried that, "Doctor, is it possible that his lips will be cut open with scissors?"
The doctor waved his hand dismissively, after all, it wasn't a strong adhesive.
It was actually quite simple; when glue accidentally stuck to you, you should either use wind oil or warm water. Although Bao Tian Hao got stuck on the lip, using warm water is better.
I quickly poured a bowl of warm water and Zhao Tianhao buried his face, sticking out his lips. I gently helped him rub the place that was stuck.
After the doctor left, I yawned while helping him rub his lips, slowly falling asleep as he moved his hands. "Uh-uh-uh—"
When Zhao Tianhao reminded me, I shook off my sleepiness and ignored my tired hands to continue rubbing.
We rubbed until it was 3:30 AM before we finally separated his lips.
He looked uncomfortable with a slight tremble at the corner of his mouth.
This is when he's about to explode. I hurriedly apologized, "Zhao Tianhao, old man, I didn't mean to!"
"If you had done that first, then you have to make it up to me."
I watched him inspectively and couldn't help but swallow my saliva nervously while watching him tightly grasp his chest.
"Since this happened because of your fault, then you need to compensate me."
He asked me what time I was going to work tomorrow, along with him bringing my computer. I realized it was because of that incident and breathed a sigh of relief.
When the company staff saw me, they greeted me warmly, asking when I had become so familiar with them. How funny, I've been there several times before, how could I not be familiar?
Since I didn't sleep well last night, my eyes were droopy and my head felt dizzy. Zhao Tianhao noticed this and picked up the phone to call our secretary, asking her to bring over two cups of coffee.
The secretary came with a cup of coffee, standing tall with an hourglass figure, showcasing her high ponytail and elegant makeup. She had a very mature charm that drew people in.
I couldn't help but think about it again, "Secretary sister, you're really beautiful, are you maybe the boss's type?"
He chuckled and pointed at me with his finger, "What's wrong with my brain? My husband is sitting outside right now."
"…Oh."I slowly pulled out my computer from its black bag and placed it on my desk. I looked at the cartoon fish sticker on the screen, paused for a moment, then opened the lid, still looking at the small cartoon fish stickers on the keyboard. The computer booted up, and I stared blankly at the screen with the bubble-like cartoon fish and Stardust wallpaper again.
Suddenly, the computer emitted a loud voice: "Stardust, let's catch an octopus!" "Stardust, let's catch an octopus!"
Zhao Lin was filled with black lines on his face.
I hurriedly said, "If you don't like this startup sound, can you change it?"
He didn't say anything and kept tapping my cartoon fish keyboard.
I cursed to myself, "Don't be so serious about not liking something already."
He suddenly had a craving for bubble gum and was staring at me with his mouth open. I puffed out my cheeks and threw the sugar stick at him.
I lay down on the sofa, feeling relaxed enough to fall asleep. But just as I was drifting off, someone kicked my face, making me jump up and shout loudly, "What the...?" I immediately swung a punch at Zhao Lin, but it ended up hitting a piece of paper with the word "裁" (a title) that his secretary was holding.
The air froze...
I stuttered, "Who called you out for watching horror movies when I wasn't expecting it... That punch was just an instinctive reflex..."
Zhao Lin walked over to stop a crowd of stunned employees who were staring at him with their mouths dropped. I sat in the passenger seat, looking at Zhao Lin's red-stamped hand, and took a deep breath, "You won't scare me again."
He smirked and said, "I didn't expect you to react so strongly. I won't scare you anymore."
Hmm? How did he not get angry?
I thought of that beautiful secretary and then told him, "Give her a raise, she worked hard today."
When we got halfway there, I felt thirsty, so I stopped at a noodle shop to buy a bottle of water. While waiting in line, I saw Wu Doctor sitting by the window eating noodles and caught his eye.
He also noticed me and waved for me to come over through the glass door.
I sat down across from him and chatted with him for a while.
When we talked about my previous therapy sessions, he mentioned that Wu Doctor was divorced. He then told me that I shouldn't get married anytime soon either, making Wu Doctor sigh.
I bluntly said, "Not yet, but it's probably coming soon."
Wu Doctor shook his head and said, "If you tell me as soon as you get divorced, I won't believe it anymore. We can stick together and make a living somehow."
"No way, don't even think about it." Zhao Lin suddenly appeared and took my hand.
"You bought water why did you come here?" he asked, teasingly.
I saw the boss's greedy nature again and quickly bid farewell to Wu Doctor.
When we got home, Li Ma had already prepared dinner. When I opened the pot, I was surprised to see that it was person's heart chicken soup. Suddenly, I thought of my mother, so I asked Li Ma about the origin of this dish.
Fortunately, it turned out that Li Ma made it for me as a supplement.
Here is the rest of the translation:
As we were driving back home, Zhao Lin suddenly said, "You know what? I think you're overreacting."
I laughed and said, "No way, he really scared me!"
Zhao Lin smiled and patted my hand. "Don't worry about it."
I thought for a moment and then asked him if his secretary had gotten married yet.
Zhao Lin's eyes lit up, and he replied, "Actually, she did. But you don't know anything about her."
I didn't believe him and teased, "Oh yeah? What do you know?"
Zhao Lin chuckled and said, "That's not the point. The point is that I think we should get married too."
I was shocked.
We stopped at a ramen shop on the way back home. When we arrived, Wu Doctor saw us through the window and waved for me to come over again.
I walked in and sat down across from him. We chatted some more, but I still couldn't help asking about his divorce.
Wu Doctor smiled wistfully and said, "It's all because of women."
I took a deep breath and asked him point-blank, "Are you saying that we should get married?"
Wu Doctor shook his head, looking serious. "No way, don't even think about it."I drank a whole bowl of chicken soup, belched loudly, and ate some food with fruit afterward.
That night, I washed my clothes and just as I was getting into bed, I felt someone beside me. I jumped out of bed immediately: "Zhao Lian Hao, what are you doing here?"
"You said your bed was uncomfortable and wanted to sleep on mine," he replied.
"I don't think it's comfortable at all," I said. "Go back to your own room."
"Do you not like me?" he asked.
"Yes,"
He looked dark and gloomy for a long time before finally trudging back to his own room.

Even my evil mother-in-law is starting to support me now
Escape story: Please keep your distance, boss
View details
Six. Even my evil mother-in-law is starting to support me now
In October, it was autumn's peak season. At night, the temperature dropped, and I turned up the air conditioning again. I wrapped myself in a blanket and started worrying about pretending to be pregnant again. Not much later, Zhao Lian Hao came over to return my computer, saying that he needed me to keep hold of it for a few days.
I didn't know what he was going to do, but I knew I had enough computers at home. Why did he need mine?
I thought back to the time he opened up his laptop and heard me setting things up, looking completely expressionless. Yeah, one big boss definitely wouldn't like Sea Otter Baby, so let's just get rid of it.
After that, I threw my computer away and continued browsing for a suitable fake belly on Taobao.
A few days later, Zhao Lian Hao gave me a whole set of clothes. I immediately became suspicious again - would he be sending me to meet some business partner or getting me to get inked?
He saw me hesitating and explained: "Don't think about anything else, I just want you to accompany me to an entertainment business event."
But as soon as he finished speaking, he took my computer away.
When I sat in the makeup room with stylists around me, taking pictures and getting ready for the event, I finally believed that this was a legitimate business event.
The event hadn't even started yet when reporters began snapping photos frantically.
Ah, isn't that Zhao Lian Hao and Lin Yu Xiang?
I quietly walked over to listen in on their conversation.
Lin Yu Xiang's voice was full of excitement: "Zhao Lian Hao, I didn't do anything wrong against you. That file belonged to Qin Ru Yi!
"You're still not taking me seriously, aren't you? Zhao Lian Hao, my last warning - don't go hurt Qin Ru Yi!"
Something warm suddenly popped up in my heart. I was surprised that the big boss wasn't as tough as I thought he would be. He still had a bit of tenderness.
I went back to the makeup room and soon saw Zhao Lian Hao holding onto my Sea Otter Baby Pen Computer again.
"Why did you take my computer?"
He hadn't even had time to answer me when his secretary sister came out to call him on stage.
I followed them from behind and hid in the shadows, watching as he went up on stage.
When he stepped up, reporters began snapping photos at him frantically.
"This is Zhao Lian Hao, CEO of弘皓 Group. Today, we're here to witness the outcome of our company's competition with Chip Frame Company. I'd like my secretary to bring my computer up now."
Here is the rest of the content:
He went up on stage and immediately started speaking. "Everyone, thank you for coming out today. We're finally here to see how our company will compete against Chip Frame."
The event had just begun, but reporters were already snapping photos at him frantically.
"Everyone, this is Zhao Lian Hao, CEO of弘皓 Group. Today, we're here to witness the outcome of our company's competition with Chip Frame Company. I'd like my secretary to bring my computer up now."
He started explaining the situation and how they were going to take on Chip Frame. The event was being broadcast live, and reporters were all over him, asking questions.
The presenter interrupted him: "Let's cut to a commercial break first. Zhao Lian Hao will continue speaking after that."
When the commercial break ended, Zhao Lian Hao went back to speaking. "We're going to do our best to win this competition. Let's show Chip Frame what we're capable of."
The event continued on, with reporters asking him questions and taking photos.
I watched from behind as he answered their questions confidently. He was good at thinking on his feet.
When the event finally ended, I walked out of the venue feeling proud of myself. We had beaten Chip Frame Company.
As I left the venue, Zhao Lian Hao came up to me and said: "You did a great job today. I'm really proud of you."
I smiled and thanked him. "It was nothing. You were amazing too."So the secretary-sister brought a seaweed baby to work on her computer.
Zhao Hengbao took over the computer: "Because the data on this computer is very important, I personally opened it and projected it."
When Zhao Hengbao opened up the computer, the sound system at the venue suddenly played my newly set up computer startup sound: "Start super transformation! Start super transformation!"
The audience burst out laughing.
Zhao Hengbao's eyebrow jumped with surprise and he explained: "Sorry everyone, this is my wife's computer. I'm not sure when she switched from Mermaid Baby to Iron Man Jr."
The CEO was completely unaffected and went on to talk about the company's new project, winning over the audience's applause.
It wasn't long after that the chip companies were called up to participate in the competition, but they surprisingly chose to abandon ship.
Things had only just happened when reporters started coming out with news: Hongbao Group thoroughly defeated Chip Company, taking first place on the new project.
I was too caught up in explaining to Zhao Hengbao "who knew you took the computer there?" that I got carried away and said something wrong again: "You're so cowardly!"
Zhao Hengbao just stared blankly. It seemed like I had messed up again.
Suddenly, the host announced that they were going to invite me and Zhao Hengbao on stage!
I quickly grabbed his sleeve: "I don't have any experience with this."
"Don't worry, just follow me." he said as we walked onto the stage.
When we got there, the emcee handed me a pen: "Can I sign something for you?"
Hmm? What do I need to sign?
Suddenly, an idea flashed into my mind. Today was definitely going to be a celebrity experience!
I stopped in my tracks and smoothly took the pen from the emcee's hand: "Thank you." 
She looked like she'd been shocked.
Zhao Hengbao looked rather stiff for a moment, so I gave him a quick thumbs up to calm him down.
As we walked onto the stage, reporters started firing off questions: "Are there rumors about your relationship being on the rocks? Are they true?"
"Is it true that you're secretly running off with someone else?"
My eyes widened when the camera flash lit up. I finally opened my mouth and said something: "Can I get a mosaic of these photos?"
The reporter was taken aback, but eventually laughed and handed me a new pen.
We stood in the center of the stage, and I began signing my name on the sign wall with steady strokes, like a kid practicing their ABCs. 
Zhao Hengbao whispered to me: "You don't have to do that."
"Okay,"
He looked serious for a moment before I started talking. 
The media was going wild, asking questions nonstop about our relationship.
I couldn't take it anymore and just said: "Can we get a mosaic of these photos instead?"I sat in the car, and received a message from Maoyan Express Station saying that my parcel had arrived.
Originally, I was supposed to be picked up by an employee, but I thought it would be more convenient to take it back myself. Zhao Lin Hao didn't object, so he drove to Maoyan Express Station.
There were many people waiting at the express station who were picking up parcels, and the delivery staff were distributing parcels.
Suddenly, a delivery man picked up a package and shouted loudly: "Guandi's chicken! Has Guandi's chicken arrived yet?"
I quickly raised my hand: "Me me me!"
The delivery man showed my phone number to me again before handing me the package.
We got back into the car, Zhao Lin Hao joked: "GuanDi's chicken... what kind of weird parcel names do you think I can come up with?"
I scowled: "What's there to think about? My parcel name isn't that hard to come up with either."
Zhao Lin Hao: "..."
I didn't expect it when we got back home and saw the boss's mother sitting on the sofa, scribbling away.
She should be talking about divorce, right?
I took a deep breath and walked over: "Mother-in-law, are you here to talk about divorce?"
She let out a cold snort: "Not just divorce."
I sat down next to her, and Zhao Lin Hao sat on the other side of me, looking worried that I would argue with her.
"Qin Rainiang, when I was in front of you last time, did you agree to get divorced? Don't play dumb with me."
"I Qin Rainiang said my words are already out, horse is hard to catch back."
The boss's face turned slightly pale.
She continued: "And also, I want to talk about Zhaoyuan's case... "
Her eyes kept glancing at me while talking.
I made it clear: "I'll avoid this conversation."
I stood up to leave, but Zhao Lin Hao held my arm back: "Just stay here for now."
He mom didn't intervene either.
Okay, you can talk about yourselves. I'm going to play with my phone.
She directly said what was on her mind: "I came to say that I want to matchmake for Zhao Lin Hao and Qin Zhaolin. I also complain a lot about you, Rainiang. As the wife of the Zhao family, you're not good at speaking in front of people, you can't even be a decent hostess."
Zhao Lin Hao refused firmly: "Actually, I'm quite happy now. If I've already married Rainiang, then I should take responsibility for being a husband and father."
I could feel the huge shock from Zhao Lin Hao when he said this. Also, the unpleasant look in his eyes towards me.
She suddenly asked me: "Qin Rainiang, what are you doing?"
"I'm playing games on my phone, mom."
She rushed over to sit beside me: "You're also playing Cool Cool? Oh, your ranking is how high is it? I've been stuck at this level for days, and I just can't get past it."
"Ah, that's because you have to do the tasks first. Once you complete them, then you can get the set."
"Oh, I see. It makes sense now."
She was suddenly enlightened."Continue she exclaimed, "How come your closet has so many clothes? Wow, this formal dress of yours how did you get it?"
"It's just collecting enough materials to make it, this one isn't that hard, it takes a bit of effort."
"Oh, I've played this game for ages every time I clear a level is a bit shaky, I wanted to spend all my money on upgrading but didn't dare to spend too much or else he would be mad at me and tell his dad. In fact, he never likes me playing games and always complains that I'm cold towards him if I spent more money on it then he would definitely make me delete it."
"I was shocked: "Uncle Brother, you're treating you so harshly? It's not near-human enough!"
She sighed, "Yes, he looks rich but in reality, he's stingy every day only allows me to buy five bags of makeup which is barely enough for me, what's the point of having that many?"
"He hasn't even bought me a bag yet."
"He's overdoing it! He's so unfair!"
She said while starting to berate her own son, "You can't do this, women can't live without bags, and Rain Vivi is your wife too!"
Zhao Gleam Cold: "..."
I was taken aback, what's going on here?
I gently patted her shoulder: "Auntie, are you not coming to talk about divorce?"
She scowled: "Call me mom."
I: "Oh my god!
What kind of situation is this?
I hesitantly got up and started to walk away: "Mom, I didn't expect you to come here looking for a fight."
She said with a straight face: "Who's calling me mom? Call me Mom!"
I: "What the heck?!"
Why did I have to pay good money for that Miracle Cold?
I accidentally got accepted by his mom, I was so relieved that I almost fainted, so I only contacted Qin Zhen Wan.
My husband and I agreed on making a chance encounter between Qin Zhen Wan and Zhao Gleam Cold, so I asked him to come out.
He surprised me when he found out I invited him: "I didn't think you'd do something like this."
I was also shocked that he accepted it so easily, I thought he wouldn't agree but I had already made up my mind to separate from him.
When we arrived at the destination, Qin Zhen Wan and Cold Wind were waiting there too, a scenic area with towering mountains on both sides. There was a vast lake at the entrance, then some bamboo forests and man-made wooden paths with stone bridges in between, a small stream flowing gently under the bridges.
The scenery calmed down my mood but I didn't have time to appreciate it.
I secretly asked Qin Zhen Wan how she brought Cold Wind along.
She said she was innocent, Cold Wind knew about this beforehand and told her that if they got together then he could take advantage of the situation.
Me: "..."
Cold Wind suddenly suggested going on a cable car ride.
A cable car?!He furrowed his brow:"You didn't tell me there was anyone else?"
"Oh, you mean Xiao Chuan," he said coolly, "I don't know what to do about him. If you're really not comfortable with him, just pretend he doesn't exist."
He rubbed his forehead:"That's not what I meant...".
Suddenly Xiao Chuan proposed going over the glass bridge."
I let out a cold sweat and felt my heart racing at the sight of the glass bridge. "Glass bridge!!" 
I stood on the bridgehead, gazing down at the scenery before me, and couldn't help shivering. Xiao Chuan had already taken plenty of photos on the bridge. 
"Cold Wei, why aren't you coming up?" Xiao Chuan walked over and grabbed my hand, pulling me towards the bridge. 
I frantically held onto the railing:"Don't panic, I just need to do a bit of mental preparation."
"No way," he said stubbornly, "This is too good an opportunity not to take some photos." He insisted on pulling me up the bridge, and I could only cling to the railing for dear life. 
"Ahahaha, Xiao Chuan, let go!" I watched my feet below and called out in terror. 
Qin Zhanwen and Zhao Lin Hao heard our commotion and rushed over. Qin Zhanwen also joined forces with Xiao Chuan, pulling me up the bridge again:"Sister, you can't disappoint such a beautiful scenery! We all agreed on this, didn't we?"
By now I was being dragged so hard that my half-body was dangling off the edge of the bridge. If I looked down, I could see the top of the mountain. 
I grabbed onto the railing again, hanging by a thread, pleading with them to stop. 
But then I felt myself falling, and I realized it was because Boss Wang was holding onto my leg, pulling me towards the bridge. 
"Let go!" I shouted, my nose dripping with tears. 
Boss Wang didn't give in to their strength, watching me on the verge of falling off the bridge, before finally releasing his grip. He winced in pain but still hadn't let go. 
I continued to struggle, making a lot of noise as I tried to wriggle free. Then my foot accidentally kicked Boss Wang's lower jaw, sending him stumbling backward. His face twisted in pain, he groaned again, but didn't give up. 
That was when I realized that one kick had sent him stumbling back far enough for me to break free. My feet scrambled to get a hold of something, and my heart pounded with fear. 
Finally, Qin Zhanwen saw Zhao Lin Hao being kicked to the ground and immediately let go, running over to check on him:"Lin Hao, are you okay? Is your chest hurting?"
Xiao Chuan finally realized what was going wrong and let go of me, letting me quickly sit back down on the bridgehead. It wasn't until then that I noticed my back was soaked through with sweat. 
After that, Xiao Chuan kept sending me apologetic messages, saying he didn't know I had acrophobia. 
"Okay" - three words that drove me crazy. So I ended up setting an automated response. 
Since the glass bridge incident, Boss Wang has been in a terrible mood for days, even becoming depressed and gloomy. 
Finally, I worked up the courage to ask him:"Was it my kick that made you this miserable?"
He shook his head:"No."
I pressed on:"So why are you like this these few days?"
He sighed and refused to answer any more questions. 
The depths of a man's heart can be unfathomable. 
Then he said he wanted to take me shopping, something I wasn't looking forward to but eventually agreed to because I didn't want him to be depressed anymore.We arrived at the mall and found many shops offering promotions, and finally, he bought me my first Louis Vuitton bag.
I hugged the bag tightly and asked him cautiously, "If we ever divorce, will you take this bag back?"
He was taken aback and replied, "You really like this bag, don't you?"
I nodded.
He smiled and said, "If you want this bag, then we can't get divorced. It's a matter of principle."
I nonchalantly pushed the bag into his arms.
Since he eventually has to return it, why not just not get it in the first place?
His expression darkened slightly and he asked, "Rain, do you really not understand what I'm saying?"
I was frozen, watching him as he said, "I've been circling around and wasting time with you, spending too much time playing with you, translating all these words... I know you'll act like you did before, pretending not to think about it, but I still have to say, I don't like you pairing me up with Qingwen, or hanging out with those guys, Qingwen and Coldyan... what I like is you."
His eyes welled up with tears and he said, "I'm so sorry for all the terrible things I did to you before. If I could do it all over again, I wouldn't do any of it. Please forgive me, Rain… don't say anything about divorce anymore. Please."
I was taken aback by his outburst and didn't know what to say, so I just said, "Let's go buy some fruit."
He saw me speak and immediately lit up with excitement, pulling a small cart towards us.
The fruit section was huge, and I bought some oranges and apples, then spotted lychees at an unbeatable price.
Girder saw me thinking about buying the lychees and immediately called over a shop employee to help us pick out one. 
"Sir, this one is really cheap," Girder said.
The employee smiled and replied, "This lady's husband says it's good for kneeling."
I:「……”
Zhang Zhan laughed reassuringly, "I'll kneel the lychee over here and give it to you as an apology."
He turned around to discuss with the employee about which lychee to choose. 
"If we buy two, one on each side, and make sure they're really good ones."
I:「……”
We spent half a day buying fruit back home, and just as Girder was about to leave, his phone rang, signaling an important project discussion.
He didn't want to go but eventually went anyway after I convinced him. Before leaving, he reminded me to wait for him to come back.
When we walked in the door, I smelled that familiar scent again. I rushed into the kitchen and found a package of pork sausages on the table!
I asked Li mom who sent them, and she revealed that the old lady from Ronghua Village had sent them specially just for us.
I looked at the two cooked sausages and my mouth began to water.
"Quinn Rain, come out here!"
It sounded like Quinn Qingwen.
Just as I was about to react, Quinn Qingwen burst into the kitchen and slapped me on the cheek.「Qin Yuwei, you're not saying you'll help me? You lied to me! You actually secretly flattered Tianhao's mother!」
One slap stunned me, my ears ringing. I went back, why did I do that? Why must I be so impatient? Old Tiger never shows his claws, and you're acting like Hello Kitty?!
I raised my hand to hit her back, but Qin Zhanwen quickly grabbed my wrist.
I struggled to break free, but she spoke up before I could: "What kind of moisturizing lotion do you use? It feels so slippery."
"I bought it from Taobao's official flagship store."
"Send me the link!"
"I'll send it."
I pulled out my phone and sent her the link after that. She leaned in to sniff at a pot, suddenly bursting into stars eyes: "Wow, what kind of flavor is this? So fragrant!"
Then the CEO walked in and saw us eating dinner.
"Sister, where did you buy this sausage? It's really delicious."
"This sausage was taken from Tianhao's grandmother. We ate it there last time too - it's so fragrant again!"
Qin Zhanwen added a second bowl: "Ah, I'm starving my mother again."
The CEO stared at us with a puzzled expression: something wasn't right here.
Qin Zhanwen saw him come back and reflexively lowered her chopsticks, but then thought better of it and picked them up again: "I don't need to do that. I was just kidding all along."
She quickly devoured the second bowl, let out a satisfied burp, and added a third.
I ate too much for dinner and felt uncomfortable, with my stomach bloated and aching. The CEO bought me some stomach-soothing pills at night, but they didn't help much. Eventually, I fell into a deep sleep, lulled by the sound of voices in my head.
When morning came, I woke up feeling restless and confused. I called out for my mother-in-law, but there was no answer.
What's going on?!
I walked to the kitchen, looking around, and the icebox was empty...Unable to be untamed and lovable, she's always up to some mischief regardless of color or background.
Whoever tries to keep up with her rhythm is doomed to fail.
Life is carefree and exciting.
Sometimes she drives people crazy and refuses to back down.
Other times she makes them feel uncomfortable and unsure of themselves.
If you want to get close to her,
You need to learn how to read between the lines.
She's a bit mysterious and unpredictable.
That's just who she is, full of mystery and unpredictability.
Her mischievous streak is just one part of what makes her so lovable.
Grandma reminds me that Zhao Lin Hao was asking me to marry him recently.
I raised an eyebrow, the situation is obvious even without saying anything.
"Rain Yi, here, have a bite of cake." The CEO looks downcast.
The CEO's mom chimes in with some surprising news: "My son and you are meant to be, I can tell. And I've already torn up our divorce agreement. Zhao Lin Hao has rewritten the marriage contract, but it's quite ridiculous. Every clause after the first one is nullified if the wife doesn't agree.
The last sentence reads, 'Whatever the wife says is final.'
I almost fell off my chair in shock. What has Zhao Lin Hao turned into? A maniac who wants me to marry him?
The CEO pulls out another gift bag and hands it to me. Inside, I find the very same cuddle pillow he gave me for his birthday last time.
However, there's an additional message on the tag: 'Please wear pants, I'm scared.'
I remain silent.
He says that he bought this pillow because he wanted a matching pair, and he desperately wants another chance at us.
The way he looks at me fills my heart with compassion, and I can't bring myself to say no.
"Okay, but you need to complete one task for me first."
The room lights up as everyone waits anxiously for the answer.
"What's that task?" 
"To clear out our sadness."「Do you not like me?」
I froze, not answering.
Am I not liked by him? Maybe I am? I don't know……
The scene fell silent, with an unpleasant atmosphere.
A song continued playing:
```
Ancient mystic
She is ancient mystic
Naughty is her trademark……
```
Cheng Chuan sent another WeChat message: Rain Vi, I forgot to tell you something, do you remember that time the loud crow happened? We got out of bed from under the blanket, on that day, Zhao Linbao told me he likes you, so we two officially declared war. Men understand men best, I know it's true. You've always liked Zhao Linbao, now he's finally approaching you, don't let him go easily.
My eyes were moist, getting up.
Everyone saw my movement and were expecting something from me. I picked up a knife to cut the cake.
Zhao Linbao excitedly said: "Rain Vi, eating the cake means accepting!"
I nodded.
Just as I was about to bite, a voice suddenly echoed in my mind: "Author don't eat it anymore! If you do, you'll have to suffer for your weight when it's time!"
I froze. Was that really Qin Rain Vi? Is yesterday's dream also hers?
I looked at the cake in my hand again and glanced at the eager face in front of me.
Yes, I'm not really Qin Rain Vi, so what should I do then?
Zhao Linbao likes one Rain Vi or the other...
---
Small extra? Zhao Linbao episode
I don't know when it started, but Rain Vi no longer worries about her feelings and seems to dislike me.
When I first released my burden, I was going to formally divorce her, but thinking of grandma's love for her, I just kept delaying things until she ate the cake.
I never expected that this lively one would slowly capture me. Every morning, brushing teeth, washing face, all she could think about were: "What will Rain Vi do today?"
So I'm waiting every day to see her, talk to her, and watch how she messes everything up... although it's actually me who gets into trouble.
Since she became ancient mystic, I've become "definitely unlucky", always getting myself into awkward situations.
Cheng Chuan said I liked Rain Vi.
Suddenly I realized I didn't know my own feelings. I kept telling myself that I loved Lingxian all along, not Rain Vi, not Rain Vi...She asked me, "If I weren't your Qin Yuyi, would you still like me?"
She couldn't possibly not be Qin Yuyi.
I may have given hints to myself that there were doubts, but the seed she had planted earlier suddenly burst through the soil. But is she even Qin Yuyi? What does it mean if she's not?
I didn't want her to leave me, I just wanted to stay with her in this moment.
After being rejected for two days, I went to the office and employees kept asking where Qin Yuyi was, saying that without her, their days were so boring.
That's true, without Qin Yuyi, these days are meaningless.
So, I called an emergency meeting with the theme of "mood-boosting gameplay techniques."
Qin Yuyi said she would only accept me if I could beat a certain level in this game.
Employees asked me, "Is the chairman going to venture into the gaming industry?"
Just before the meeting started, Chankuo announced a news that they were investing in games that eliminate or remove classes.
Me:「……"
It seems like the CEO of Chankuo is idolizing me and blindly following my every decision.
At the meeting, I asked employees if anyone had played "Melancholic Elimination Game" and reached which level?
Everyone said they only reached around 800 levels.
I was taken aback, Qin Yuyi had already beaten over 3,000 levels.
Given their lack of experience, I decided to try it myself.
It turned out this game was created to help Village Chief.
So, I played for hours without stopping until I finally beat over 1,200 levels.
Then, she sent me a text message. It was an emoji with a panda face and the words "ugly thing, come chat."
I laughed and then she sent another one saying, "We'll meet you at your office later, don't leave."
My heart skipped a beat as I thought maybe she was going to reveal her decision.
As soon as we heard employees chatting outside, she walked in with a smile. She leaned over to look at the game window I hadn't closed yet.
"Oh, I've caught up to you! I'm here for work, don't try to sneak out!
"You said that if I beat this level, you'd accept me."
She paused, then suddenly began crying again. "You're serious?"
I sighed and wrapped my arms around her. "Seriously."
She sniffled and said, "I thought a lot about it... We should go rescue Village Chief together."
"Good, we'll go together..." I was shocked and exclaimed...
"Rain Yuyi, did you agree?"She lifted her head from my chest, bent down on tiptoes and touched my lower lip with a kiss: "I agree, you're a deadbeat."
My heart felt like summer lake water being tossed about by passing boats.
Rainy, my Rainy...
She suddenly placed her hand in front of my face and blinked her eyes: "My hands are empty."
I laughed: "Where's the emptiness? I'm watching your muscles are plenty full."
She paused for a moment before saying: "Look, my ears are also empty."
"I can see them too," I said. "You wait, I'll go back to help you dig out those ear lobes."
Then my little leg started hurting: "Rainy, you kicked me really hard."
"Ha! You're not kicking anyone else but yourself," she crossed her arms, turned her head away from me and refused to look at me.
"I'll go buy another duck egg and a more expensive earring for you," I said reluctantly.
7.
The story of Little Yellow Duck and Big White Swan, have you heard it?
Escape Story: Please Scold the CEO a Bit More
Are you interested in hearing about Little Yellow Duck and Big White Swan?
Since we've been together, my mom has been getting more comfortable with me. She often texts me to go shopping or chat.
"Go check out your husband at work," my mother-in-law expressed her concern: "Zhao Lin Hao hates bitter soup, even after a few days he can't handle it, I'm worried that he'll vomit during meetings."
I tightly hugged her: "I won't dare, if he treats me like this what will I do?"
She looked off into the distance: "This is your price for teasing him."
There was no way to escape from this situation. I had to send a message to see how things were going.
Me: CEO, why did you hate bitter soup so much?_?
CEO: It's fine now.
Hmm... didn't he say it would be like that for two or three days?
Me: Why is that?
CEO: Because you're too sweet.
I'm silent
I'm seriously suspecting that he's been drunk.
I only had to ask my secretary sister again.
But she sent a video right away:
The conference room was filled with people watching as Zhao Lin Hao enthusiastically talked on his phone. He looked handsome, stood tall and exuded an aura of cold seriousness.
Everyone's eyes were glued to the screen, their eyes never wavering for a moment, afraid of being caught by this CEO who could use poisonous words at any time.===== CONTENT TO TRANSLATE =====
滴滴——
A message on a large screen appears with a WeChat note saying " Zhao Bing is eating next to Xiaogua's small guava.
「Boss, I don't know why you're so disgusted with bitter melon?」
What?! Everything has been recorded!
Secretary sister says they thought the boss would quietly shut it down, but he actually responded on the spot. The employees are like they've seen a pink bubble around Zhao Bing's head).
The video ends, and the screen freezes. He's sitting there, laughing like a Shiba Inu.
My heart water is like a small pinecone dropped into my lake, causing ripples everywhere.
Boss mom suddenly laughs with excitement: "Go ahead, it's just right for you to bring this back to your husband."
My cheeks start to flush.
He brings two bento boxes to the company and employees can't help but show off that silly expression of "滑稽" (ridiculous) when they see me:
I look embarrassed and quickly make my way to Zhao Bing's office.
He's sitting with his head down, looking at files.

I stand in front of him, nodding my head.
He looks up at me with bright eyes: "Ruiyi, why are you here?"
「Of course I brought lunch for you.」
「Then why did you take mine?」
「Then what do you want me to do about it?」
「……」
I'm telling the truth,
He puts down his chopsticks and wraps his right arm around my shoulder: "If you admit to eating my lunch, then I expect compensation."
I look at him in surprise, still not ready to react, and he suddenly presses his lips against mine.
My head explodes with a loud sound, one heart pounding continuously like crazy, feeling like my hair is on fire.
He releases me, I'm too embarrassed to lift my head, so I burrow my face into his chest.
Zhao Bing whispers in my ear: "Why don't we sleep together tonight?"Now I feel so embarrassed that even my toes are red.
I pretended to be calm: "I, I haven't prepared enough yet."
Just then someone knocked on the door: "Mr. President, there's a proposal to review you."
I jumped up from the couch immediately: "You work first, and I'll get a cup of coffee.".
Luckily it was lunchtime, so the corridor was empty; otherwise people would tease me about having red face like boiled crab.
I downed two cups of coffee in one go, calming my racing heart.
I put my bag on the table, and my mind became troubled: is Zhao Liang's development too fast for us? But we're already a married couple, isn't that normal anyway? But I still haven't talked to him about it.
I got annoyed.
I shook my head, not thinking anymore, let's just play with my phone.
I looked through my bag and found my phone, but the button was almost falling off.
I had to go ask an employee for a bottle of 502.
The exit was blocked by glue, so I strained myself to squeeze some out; though it wasn't much, it should do.
Just as I was using force to push the fake stone, I accidentally knocked down the glue and stepped on the bottle, spilling all sorts of gel out.
I frantically picked up the bottle, ran back in with a broom, but just then Zhao Liang walked in.
So I stared blankly at him, not noticing his feet were stepping into that mess.
We both stood there, staring at each other; his face slowly darkened.
I dropped the broom and rushed towards him: "This is 502."
"This"
"You walk without looking where you're going…"If previously translated content is also given, use it as reference.
Combine multiple empty lines in a row into a single one.
Good grief, it really stuck.
He rested for a while and told me to let him pass, he came.
“Alright, let's go together. I'll hold your shoe, you grab my waist, and we can make a go of it.”
He thought for a moment and decided that maybe there was some point to it, so he listened and did as he said.
With his added effort, the shoe seemed to be starting to move slightly.
“Ah, it's moving! Keep going!”
At this point, footsteps outside started making a high-heeled shoe noise.
I and he turned our heads simultaneously towards the door and saw their secretary standing there holding files with her face rapidly flushing red, nervously turning around: “I'll be back later, you guys keep going.”
She walked away while bringing the door up with her.
I was confused, turning my head again, “What's wrong with her?”
Zhao Lian Bao was also staring blankly, his expression just as puzzled as mine, “No idea.”
“Alright, forget about it, let's continue anyway.”
My words had barely left my lips when Zhao Lian Bao seemed to suddenly wake up and released me from our grasp, his face deep red, “I'll do it myself.”
“Ahh?”
“I'll do it myself…”
He said no more, bending down to pick at the shoe in silence.
After we both applied our efforts, the shoe started moving a bit, Zhao Lian Bao didn't need much time before he heard a sucking sound and finally pulled out the shoe.
However…
“Lian Bao, your shoes are still stuck to the ground…”
“I know.”
“The quality of these Italian handmade shoes is really bad. You're just a master at making yourself look good with cheap stuff.”
“These shoes aren't mine, they're yours from that time you bought them on Taobao for a single person sale.”
“……You're still a true emperor of shoe shopping, buying overpriced crap and pretending it's designer. Oh my god, you really are something else…”
“You should stop buying things just to get people to buy with you too, we don't need that money.”
“You don't understand the joy of women...""
Zhao Lian Bao pulled his shoe apart, I had to go and help him buy another pair.
On our way back to work, we met grandma, she invited us to drink chicken soup, big repairment.
I didn't know how to say no, so I agreed anyway.
We spent a long time at her house until nightfall when finally finished drinking the chicken soup.
Both of us had some issues with the soup, especially grandma's. But grandma insisted, I could only agree.
To avoid saying it directly, we kept telling that we weren't hungry and could eat anything, but grandma just wouldn't listen, so we ended up taking leftovers back home to drink later.However, only an hour ago, I was starving to the point of my heart practically sticking to my back. More importantly, I was sitting in the passenger seat, surrounded by the pungent aroma of street food that occasionally floated past the window.
"Boss, driving must be really boring for you, right? Want to hear a little story?"
"Okay, tell me."
Once I got his consent, I began telling this brand new story: "One day, a big white swan was thinking about its old friend Little Yellow Duck and decided to go all the way to Little Yellow Duck's house to knock on the door: 'Little Yellow Duck is home? Little Yellow Duck is home?'
" Inside, Little Yellow Duck responded: 'Hello, who are you?'
"'Hello duck, I'm a swan.'
"Little Yellow Duck looked a bit surprised and asked again: 'You're good at it, but I didn't quite catch what you said. Can you say it again?'
"The big white swan repeated: 'I'm a swan, I'm a swan, I'm a swan.
"Little Yellow Duck this time finally understood, but he was too afraid to open the door because his mom had told him that there were many bad guys in the world.
"Anyway, he asked again: 'Are you a good duck?'
"The big white swan patiently replied: 'I'm a good swan, I'm a good swan, I'm a good swan!'"
"There Zhao was suddenly snorted and turned to me with a grin: "What do you want?"
"Squid noodles."
"Something nutritious."
"Squid noodles with eggs..."
"We just walked into the squid noodle shop, and there were several young girls staring at Boss Zhao.
"Oh, it's impossible not to have an advantage when someone is that handsome!
"After we ordered, old lady boss came over with a big bowl of squids.
"But why did Zhao's bowl have so much sauce?!"
"Boss Zhao handed me his bowl anyway.
"He ate slowly and deliberately, while the two young girls at the next table had almost finished their noodles after ten minutes and were still waiting for the bill."
"I looked up at the man in front of me and couldn't help but sigh: Maybe that's what people say is blue blood disease?
"After I finished my noodle, I still felt like something was missing.
"'Boss Zhao, are you going to finish that story?'
"He glanced away briefly before looking interested again: 'What happens next?'
"'Well,' I continued, 'even though the big swan said it was a good swan, Little Yellow Duck was still too afraid to open the door because his mom had warned him about bad guys changing into good guys. But with time passing, good guys can also turn into bad guys.
"Anyway, Little Yellow Duck kept waiting and estimated that once the good guy turned into a bad guy, he could finally open the door: 'Is there still a swan outside?'
"The big swan was happy to hear him speak at last: 'I'm still here!'
"'Are you still as good as before?'
"The big white swan replied firmly: 'I'm a good swan, I'm a good swan!'"I said that, and the CEO couldn't help but laugh, accompanied by his laughter and also the laughter of a customer at the next table.
I turned my head to face him, and he just so happened to turn around too.
He was a man, slightly overweight, wearing black-framed glasses.
He looked me up and down for a bit, then suddenly exclaimed: "You're Qin Yuyue?"
I was taken aback: "Who are you?"
"Ah, I'm your classmate from university," he said. "And you quit school that year, when I was the class president."
It seems like he might be making an impression now, because Qin Yuyue and Zhao Linhao got married two years ago, and she was still a third-year student at the time.
Although my description of him back then was just a bit...
He invited me to attend the alumni gathering that day before we parted ways.
To be honest, I really wanted to go, since I've been here for so long without making any friends.
But the CEO is an extremely possessive person, and he would never agree to me going.
What a problem.
I posted a question on Zhidao: "I want to attend the alumni gathering, but I'm afraid my boyfriend won't allow it. What should I do?"
Not long after, there were responses from various users. Most of them suggested that I try talking to him about it, explaining how much I really wanted to go.
However, one user took a opposing view: "I strongly oppose this," with many likes. The commenter said that the CEO's possessiveness is definitely strong, and since it's just an alumni gathering, it's unlikely he would ever allow me to attend. They suggested that either I don't go at all, or sneak out without him finding out.
Another user took a rather unusual view: "What else can we do? Of course, let's bring our boyfriends along!"
I mentally prepared myself for the worst-case scenario: bringing my boyfriend and then getting into a fight. Maybe I should just drop it now.
Finally, another user suggested that instead of worrying about this, I should just ask him directly.
Ask him...
Since I'm stuck here, I went to Zhao Linhao's office and told him what happened. To my surprise, he agreed without any hesitation.
I replied to the original commenter: "Okay, so you said go talk to him, and then I would go ahead and kiss him before asking if it was okay..."
The commenter just stared at me silently, clearly wondering why I wouldn't do that in the first place.
Now that I've gotten Zhao Linhao's approval, I'm trying to figure out what to wear tomorrow.
I had originally planned to check out a fashion blogger on Weibo when... I saw a hot search result that was beating the wall: "Zhao Linhao, CEO of弘皓 Group, dines with an unknown woman at night, and is surprisingly low-key. Netizens are all speculating whether this mysterious woman is his wife or girlfriend."
My friends must know that Zhao Linhao is nicknamed "Novel-style CEO" because he's the inspiration for those novels... But it turns out that he's a big deal in the business world and has been secretly married to someone for two years. It looks like there was a scandal about him not getting along with his wife, even going so far as to accuse her of running off with another guy.
Theories are already popping up left and right: is this mysterious woman Zhao Linhao's real wife or just one of his girlfriends?Here's the translation of the content:
The next photo shows me eating stir-fried squids with my boss.
News came out just a few minutes ago, but comments piled up to over 10,000 floors!
Key point: I bet five cents, definitely it's my girlfriend, or else I'll go live on stream and cut my hair.
Look at brother's waist: The picture is so blurry, even with a microscope, the photographer wouldn't be able to recognize him.
Your wine glass is empty: Zhao Yang Hao: Stir-fried squids, paid for it.
Running high in heaven's marathon contestant: Come check this out, @Zhao Yang Hao just opened his Weibo!
I went through the portal and entered, but it was just a blank profile picture. My fan numbers skyrocketed to the point where I blinked and saw hundreds of thousands!
I clicked follow again and came back, and saw a hot comment reply: Zhao Yang Hao: You guessed wrong.
The person who witnessed the incident responded, and the floor was flooded with comments in an instant, mostly saying squatting on the main live stream.
My phone started buzzing nonstop with notifications, the screen displaying red circles with increasing numbers. I tried to click in but couldn't, and eventually my phone crashed!
What the…? Did Weibo crash?
After a while, I tried clicking again but it was still slow. This is ridiculous!
I opened up my private messages and almost fainted.
User one: Are you the wife of the CEO? Zhao Yang Hao only follows you alone!
User two: Caught the CEO's girlfriend alive!
User three: You're not a Weibo member, you don't have the right to join our club.
User four: Why doesn't your Weibo post pictures of you eating all day? I want to see what you look like, or else I'll die from heart attack.
I suddenly felt lucky that I didn't have the habit of posting photos of myself eating...
I opened up my bookshelf door and said: “Zhao Yang Hao, aren't you never on Weibo?”
“I was bored, so I thought I'd check it out.”
My fan numbers increased so fast. Maybe I should be more careful in the future.
I guess I'll think about what to wear tomorrow instead.
When getting dressed, Zhao Yang Hao's sister called me and asked me to go pick up her little brother at kindergarten this afternoon, saying she had to ask me for a favor because he was being stubborn all day. She said that his friend was bragging about riding the bus last week and now he wanted to ride the bus with me.
That's right, I haven't seen him in a few days. Let's make sure he can ride the bus tomorrow.
I stood there looking at ants moving around when someone handed me a brochure with an eye-catching sentence: Joy羊羊 kids' rocking chair, kids will never want to get off!
I looked up and saw a girl who looks like a university student.
You're a part-time college student?
She nodded eagerly:
Let's go!I had always known my inner saint's soul was burning fiercely:
"She doesn't think it's a good idea."
"I'm feeling pretty bored now, so I'll just pass on some of this to you."
She waved her hand.
"I'm not really doing anything interesting right now, so I might as well help you waste some time."
She didn't say no after hearing that.
So she went to a busy street and started handing out flyers. I handed them out too.
A car with four wheels pulled up in front of me, and the driver got out. He was tall, had short black hair, and wore silver grey clothes. It was a well-known young man who looked very serious.
I handed him a flyer, but he didn't take it. He just stared at me intensely.
Why was he looking at me like that? Wasn't he in love with me at first sight?
It was my fault for not having anywhere to put my charm.
He quickly took the hand holding the flyer: "Qin Yuyan, don't you remember me?"
I didn't know who he was.
"I forgot."
"Ha ha, I wouldn't have thought so," he said. "We were in a club together back when we first joined. You two became close friends after that."
He mentioned it to me and suddenly a memory popped into my head. It turned out the guy with the big head was called Liang Lin Deep.
I shook my head.
"You're really forgetting, huh?"
"Oh no, I'm just joking," he said with a smile.
I didn't say anything.
Sorry, brother, I truly don't remember you.
"Hey, do you think I could meet your daughter?"
He blushed and rubbed his face: "No, not that fast. I came to pick up my sister."
"She's a teacher here,"
"Not her. She's in school."
"Too old for each other, huh, I'm not sure."
We chatted like this from him to me without really talking.
From what he said, I realized that the guy was actually Liang Lin Deep, who used to run around in lion costumes.
"Ah ha! I remember now,"
"I told you it wouldn't be a problem,"
I: "......"
Sorry, I don't know how to say it.I told him I didn't bring pamphlets, but I was here today to pick up my nephew.
I didn't realize how many parents had already come to pick up their children. I took advantage of the crowd and distributed the pamphlets quickly.
"Where's your car?"梁林深 asked me.
"I took the bus,"
he was stunned:"I thought all the kids reading books here were from wealthy families, with a monthly tuition fee of several tens of thousands of dollars. It's also unfair to be harsh on children who suffer and poor education."
I was about to explain when I heard little Cheng excitedly calling out "sister")
He rushed over, and I picked him up, saying:"You've gained weight, haven't you?"
"Not at all," he said, "I just miss my sister so much, and I'm skinny anyway."
I felt like I'd been hit by a kid...
梁林深 looked at us suspiciously:"You weren't coming to pick up the nephew? Why did he call you 'sister'?"
Before I could respond, little Cheng said "Because all the pretty girls I see are sisters to me. It's so unfair that we're not allowed to say it anymore. We should go catch a bus.""
I smiled apologetically at梁林深 and took little Cheng to the bus station.
Not long after, the bus arrived, and we found a spot behind the bus. Little Cheng was experiencing the bus ride for the first time and was looking around everywhere.
That kid is very intelligent, I didn't even bother him.
Suddenly, in the quiet carriage, little Cheng's high-pitched voice drew attention from the passengers:"Miss sister, can you wait for me for 20 years?"
I was shocked, following his gaze to see a beautiful-haired girl:
The girl smiled and replied "Little friend, do you have any brothers who look like you?":)
"No, but I have an uncle who's very handsome, he got married early, so we can't meet. It's only me now."
Everyone was silent.......
After a long day of work, I went to bed tired and received a message from my friend Yang saying:
Can you help me respond to my fans? I'm too busy with night classes not to play my phone. Microblog username:183xxxxxxxx, password:zis1du1, thank you!
I logged into his microblog, his username is "Morning Wind Blows, Hair Doesn't Grow", which has over a million fans and he describes himself as an emotional blogger who helps people come up with ideas.
So I'm supposed to help my fans come up with ideas? 
Fan 1 said: There's something I want to discuss with you. It's like this... I really hate one of my friends, we've been distant for a long time, but she never asks me anything and it's so frustrating. I don't know how to deal with it. Please help me.
I replied that you could make her initiate the conversation by sending her endless links to Valentine's Day gift lists.
Fan 1 said that was a great idea 
I realized that I have a talent for helping people solve their problems.粉丝二： Oh, brother, brother, I've been really stressed out for two days now. The thing is, my boyfriend has always been pretty cool, but yesterday I accidentally found out he loves wearing skirts behind me, and it really messed with my head, so please help me out.
I'm not very good at counseling people like this.
You： If you truly love him, then you should love his hobbies too, and love me like that too. Love is like a flame, it can't be separated from life.
粉丝二： But I don't think I can accept my boyfriend liking skirts and being a "big shot" in the drag community like me.
You： That's a lot of information all at once, bro.
粉丝二： Oh, okay, I'll just take some time to get used to it. Thanks, brother.
I was still trying to process everything when another fan came along.
粉丝三： Hey, brother, I'm 22 years old and have been divorced for several years. I'm really scared of being alone forever and want to find a girlfriend, but I just can't seem to find anyone.
You： Several years of divorce? That's a lot to take in.
粉丝三： Yeah, we got married in a hurry without getting a certificate, and now that we're divorced, it's hard to find someone who will date me. As long as they don't mind kids or anything, I'm fine with that.
You： You can't really call that a second marriage. If you want to find someone like that, why not just stand outside the local marriage registration office and wait?
Powder： I didn't think of it that way! Thanks for helping me out!
After finishing counseling Powder, I put down my phone and went to sleep.
I slept until midday and had a great time with Lee Mom making steamed buns. They were so delicious.
If there's food involved, you can't help but remember the person who paid for it. Even though he's always trying to act cool, deep down I think he likes the attention.
I sent him a message:
You： Steamed buns, did you eat them?
赵霆皓： Bring some over, I'm starving!
When I arrived at the office, I sat next to his desk and ate several more steamed buns. 
He asked me when our class reunion was, and said he had to work late tonight so wouldn't be able to go with me.
The reunion is scheduled for 6 pm since it's right near the company. So I just stayed away from there. However, after being bored at work all day, I decided to step outside because it's a beautiful day today.
The city was bustling and full of life, but also had its old charm. The modernized areas were modern and lively, while the old neighborhoods still had that nostalgic feel to them. I love how old streets can be so peaceful and calm.
Unfortunately, my phone had poor reception and couldn't pinpoint my location on the map).
「Boss, are you busy?」
「……」
I could imagine his expression when he heard me saying that, looking worried and frustrated."
「你 lost or something? I'll come pick you up.」
「If I knew where I was, I wouldn't be calling you in the first place…..」
「我'm asking, what's near your location so I can find you?」If previously translated content is also given, use it as reference.
 «All the old houses and trees.»
«Say specific details.»
«It's... a tree. I don't know what kind of tree it is.»
「……»
«There's a desk under the chessboard with an old grandfather playing chess.»
He sighed: "Go ask Grandfather about the street name."
I did as he said, and Grandfather told me the street name. The boss overheard this and said to come over in his car.
I saw them playing chess and stood by watching. I had a few times wanted to say something but restrained myself. Watching without speaking was still understandable for me.
«The General!»
One game finished, the winning Grandfather happily drank tea, looked up at me and said: "I didn't expect there to be someone my age interested in chess. Come on, let's play a game."
"I don't know how," I shook my head and waved my hand.
"Ah, it's no big deal, just have fun with it."
The old gentlemen were enthusiastic, so I had to agree.
They gave me the rules from there, and I found out that chess has rhymes. Luckily, I remembered them well after listening a few times.
They all said I was good at chess, but I denied it, actually getting quite full of myself.
Just as I was enjoying this, the old gentlemen's expressions turned puzzled with a hint of seriousness: "Lady, why are you riding a horse and a car together?"
"Ah? Is it because they're pulling me along?" I said jokingly. "Horses and cars, horses and cars."
«Ha ha ha.»
The one who played chess with me won easily.
«Horses and cars.»
Who was saying this?
I looked up as the sound came from above and saw a parrot hanging from a tree in the branch.
I was teaching the parrot to say something earlier.
"Qin Ruyan is super beautiful!"
The parrot didn't repeat it back.
So I broke it down: "Qin Ruyan."
Finally, it said: "Qin Ruyan."
"Wow, parrot's powerful!" 
"Powerful! Powerful!"「……” It's not even making a sound anymore.
Zhao Linbao saw this and was shocked, his face full of black lines: "Are you bored or something?""
"Not boring, it's actually really fun!" I ignored him and continued teasing the parrot, "Qin Yuwei is an ultra-powerful supermodel!"
"Ultra-powerful supermodel, ultra-powerful supermodel!"
The boss was silent, rubbing his forehead.
"An old saying says that if you flatter someone right, life has no troubles," I taught the parrot again, "The boss's mother is really cool!
"His mother, his mother,"
I: "No, no, no, his mother is really cool!"
Parrot: "Boss, boss, his mother, Qin Yuwei is an ultra-powerful supermodel!"
I:「……"
Zhao Linbao:「……You're treating me like both dad and mom, I'm exhausted.")
I: "It's not exhausting...." 
I didn't realize it until then, but another golden hour had come and gone, the sun was setting, and I finally saw that beautiful sunset again.
Watching the beautiful scenery, I started thinking about what to wear for the class reunion again.
After a long time of consideration, I decided to wear a shirt and jeans, the old saying goes: "Ordinary is best."
Okay, that's what I said.
The director gave me the location of our class reunion, which was St Big Restaurant.
The restaurant towered above the commercial street, its decoration was very luxurious and expensive. I roughly estimated it would cost an arm and a leg to eat here.
I finally arrived at the table, surrounded by people who were already seated around the circular table. I was the last one to arrive.
Everyone stared at me when I came in, momentarily frozen in silence.
Liang Lindeep broke the silence first, "Qin Yuwei, I forgot to tell you yesterday, I thought you wouldn't come,"
I smiled and greeted everyone with a nod, "Classmates, it's been a long time!"
Everyone reacted slowly, responding with surprised reactions, saying they didn't expect me to show up. But despite the warm welcome, I could sense their reluctance towards my presence.
Next to me, a beautiful girl giggled twice, "Qin Yuwei, you have thick skin,"
I was confused, what did I do wrong?
"Hey, why aren't you talking?" someone asked,
"Who doesn't know about when you stole my boyfriend last year!" 
Someone interrupted the conversation, "Just that, good luck coming to our reunion. If it were me, I'd avoid all of you."
“Qin Yuwei, you have to apologize to Deng Ling! Say you're wrong and admit that you're cheap!”===== TRANSLATED CONTENT =====
Wait, Deng Ling Yi?
I remembered that Deng Ling Yi was the heroine of this series. I made her a love interest for Qin Yuwei because I wanted to make the story more cruel, and now she's being trampled by everyone's infatuation with her.
Oh no, I'm the one who dug this hole!
"Stop gossiping, come on, let's eat already!" Lin Lin Deep started making excuses.
"That was just a misunderstanding, we should clear it up." I think it's better to resolve this than to keep stirring up drama, "Your boyfriend is terrible, constantly bothering me and I never even had anything to do with him."
"Cut it out, you're not telling the truth!" The guy who was helping me earlier retorted.
I'm going to shut up and deal with it myself. Don't make me be rude anymore? That's why I said: "Who are you! What right do you have to call me cheap? Did your boyfriend cheat on someone else? And why are you so cruel?"
That guy's eyes widened in shock, and he was momentarily stunned.
Deng Ling Yi wasn't having it: "If there was nothing between us, then why didn't you dare face me or our classmates? I think you're just afraid of facing me because you know you're going to get expelled!"
"I was graduating for my wedding."
Everyone's jaws dropped in surprise when she revealed this.
"Hey, I thought you were the one who came with us last night!" The class president pointed out.
I nodded.
"Ha ha, you don't look like anyone I'd expect. But your boyfriend is pretty cool, I guess."
I was momentarily unsure if he was teasing me or insulting me. I mean, I didn't think I looked that bad!
Lin Lin Deep's eyes seemed to hold a hidden message: "Have you ever seen Qin Yuwei's husband?"
"Yes, but he looks familiar, like he's one of those good-looking guys who all look the same." 
The atmosphere suddenly relaxed as people began to understand each other better.
"Rain Wei, I've always wondered if you're struggling financially," Lin Lin Deep asked me next.
The guy who was standing nearby turned bright red and proudly declared: "You must have eaten at this restaurant for the first time!"
"Yes, it's my first time here." I admitted.
"You probably can't afford it." Another guy chimed in.
"I can afford to eat here too." Oh no!
"Rain Wei, if you're really struggling financially, why don't you come with me?" Lin Lin Deep said again.
Are they kidding me?
I replied: "I'm doing fine."
His expression turned serious for a moment: "I swear it's true."
Oh my god! He actually has a crush on me!
I think I need to cut through all this drama quickly: "I swear it's true too."I started to regret coming to the party, but I told myself it was fortunate I did come, otherwise I wouldn't have a chance to clarify my misunderstandings.
After finishing our meal, the team leader went to the restroom, and we left one by one.
Someone suggested going to a karaoke bar, and although I was very eager, I saw that the time was getting late and I should head home.
Just as I was about to leave the hall, someone suddenly whispered: "Ling-yi, look outside, there's a guy who looks just like Zhao Lin-hao!"
"That's not Zhao Lin-hao," Ling-yi continued, "based on my experience reading business magazines over the years, I'm sure it's him."
As soon as she said that, everyone suddenly turned their heads to look outside.
Oh my god, is he really a CEO?
I should pretend not to know him or should I pretend not to know him?
The CEO was getting closer and closer until he was right in front of us.
I think someone pushed me, and I was knocked forward straight into the CEO's arms.
The group was silent for a moment.
"Qin Rain-vi, you have a husband, why are you hugging this guy?" Ling-yi teased.
I looked up at the CEO's stern jawline and cold expression.
He coldly looked at Ling-yi and then back at me, his lips slightly parted: "Did you think I hadn't seen you?"
"Are you working late?"
"Yes, I am."
I was shocked and my mind suddenly drew a conclusion: so Zhao Lin-hao's chain restaurant is owned by him!
Suddenly I heard the voice of our class leader from far away: "Oh, the husband is hugging someone again!"
Everyone heard it at once and their eyes widened in shock.
Zhao Lin-hao said to me that he should have handled things before I got here, so let's go home together.
I nodded, no longer able to look at anyone else's expression.
The CEO left, which made the scene even more awkward than before.
Finally, our class leader broke the silence: "Ah, I remember! Rain-vi, that's why you know him so well, it's because he's the president of Hong-hao group!"
Everyone was silent again.
"Ha ha, yeah…”, I said in a stiff tone.
Ling-yi looked like she was going to cry, her face turned an unbearable shade of green.
The scene was stuck in a cycle of embarrassment for a while.
Someone teased: "Oh, Rain-vi, if you had known this earlier, we wouldn't have wasted our energy here, haha!”
I thought to myself: You guys didn't even ask either… 
More and more people started to follow suit, turning their attitude around 180 degrees.Everyone's all chatter and noise, but they ignored Liang Linshen and Deng Lian who stood outside the crowd, not saying a word.
Zhao Tianhao handled things quickly after work, and everyone immediately quieted down when he arrived.
He wrapped his arm around my shoulder: "Thank you all for taking care of my wife. We should be heading back soon."
His calm tone made the word "care" sound very heavy.
"It's nothing, it's just old classmates," they stiffly replied.
On our way home, I couldn't help sneaking glances at the boss, who was being his usual arrogant self.
"What are you doing??
"You know exactly what you're doing,"
"He hasn't seen any genuine friendships between colleagues before,"
"Hey, look over here!"
"I've been watching you all this time. Of course I see what you're doing,"
I: "..."
The boss's ability to sweep his employees off their feet is unexpected.
"How could you have known it was that Shit restaurant?" I couldn't help but feel amazed.
"St...","
"I know, it's the same thing." He shrugged off the question.
He suddenly stopped the car, and I wondered if the car had broken down again. 
"No," he said, turning off the headlights while we were still in the dark. 
The surrounding area was pitch black, with no one around, making me feel a bit scared.
"It's not even close to home yet."
"I know."
His voice was right next to mine, and I could even feel his warm breath on my skin.
My heart was racing, and I was nervously gripping the seatbelt: "Boss, you... 
"Raindrop, I want to kiss you." He leaned in very close, lightly tracing his finger over my lips.
I could hear my own heartbeat pounding against my chest.
"Yes."
He closed his eyes, and his soft lips covered mine.
So this was love?
The whole time, he never left a hint of a smile on his face. I blushed furiously and retreated home, where my mom rushed over to tell me that Little Cheng had been calling me nonstop, saying he was crying all the time and begging to see me.
Just a few minutes later, I received a video call from the boss's sister.I answered, and it was Little Cheng crying about his mother. He said he hated his mother because she scolded him, and he really missed me.
I gently asked him, "Mommy how did you scold him?"
"He said," he replied, "he said I didn't have manners."
"Why did you say that?"
"Mommy said I couldn't call him my sister's husband but instead called him uncle. But I like calling my sister my husband when I grow up."
Boss Man: "No manners"
I: "..."
Little Cheng started crying even louder, and his mother yelled at the video, "If you cry anymore, I'll take away your phone."
He immediately stopped crying, but tears kept falling down, and he was sniffing and sniffling.
I comforted him, but nothing worked.
"Little Cheng have you ever played go with five stones?"
He shook his head, crying.
"Go is fun! Don't believe me, watch me play against your uncle, okay?"
Forced to behave, Zhao Liang Ao was surprised and looked like he was saying I don't want to.
He sniffled, "I do."
Boss Man: "..."
So I asked him to get a piece of paper and two pens, then told him to draw squares.
"Look carefully, this guarantee a quick win! When you come next time, we'll play together."
"Yes"
Little Cheng was finally attracted by go, and his mood calmed down.
I started playing with Zhao Liang Ao.
"You drew the circle or cross?" I asked him.
"Random, your turn."
I drew a circle in the middle.
I thought my five stones were quite good, but Zhao Liang Ao killed me mercilessly!
He laughed every time he made a move. Meanwhile, I was left speechless.
Little Cheng exclaimed, "How did uncle beat you so easily?"
The video showed his mother yelling again, "Little Cheng, Mommy told you to be quiet! What are you looking at like that? Call out so loudly!"
I awkwardly explained that Zhao Liang Ao and I were playing go.Comforting a child is a tiresome task, I lay myself down on the bed and my mind flashed back to the scene where I was affectionate with him earlier.
Oh no, why can't this thought be pushed away?
I pulled over the blanket and covered my head, forcing myself to calm down. After a while, I finally fell asleep.
I'm sure tonight's dream will be sweet.
「Thank you.\")
What's that voice?
「我'll be back.\" This voice sounded like it was hazy in my ears.
I suddenly felt like I was drowning, with headaches throbbing through my skull.
「Today, Zhao Lian is even more in love with you. Thank you for catching him for me.\"
I felt a huge hole dug into my heart, realizing that the thing I wanted to cherish wasn't mine to begin with.
The faces of Zhao Lian and other characters flooded into my view, including the story I had created myself with the girl protagonist. It was too cliché and painful.
I couldn't help but cry out in agony, unsure if it was because I was sad for myself or because the story was too heartbreaking. All I knew was that tears blurred my vision.
Yes, this world shouldn't have me in it.
I don't know how long I've been crying, until finally the sun rose up."
I kept watching Qin Yuxiu getting up and making breakfast for Zhao Lian's character.
He looked surprised and excited, tightly hugging her:「Yuxiu.\"
If I could look at myself in a mirror, I think I'm already tears streaming down my face).

Escape Story: Please Roll Away from the CEO

8.
Back to the real world
I was woken up by the sound of a phone ringing,
「Hello, is it Ruyue Caiyi?\"
Ruyue Caiyi is my pen name.
Yes, I'm back in reality.
「Brother Lian is me.\"
Brother Lian is my editor. He told me since my 《The CEO Finally Regrets》 did well, he suggested I write another one.
But as soon as I came back, I didn't have the energy or motivation to do anything. 
So I hesitated and said I'd think about it again. My editor was calm and just said I should call him if I thought it through."
I hung up the phone and got out of bed to wash my face. When I opened the fridge, there wasn't much left for me to eat.I went downstairs to the supermarket and bought a few packets of instant noodles and some sausages, just as I got out I saw my mother-in-law.
「Mom！」I excitedly hugged her, tears streaming down my face.
She gently patted on my back： „What's wrong with this little king of mine？"""
My mother-in-law saw the plastic bag containing the instant noodles and immediately pulled down her face： „All you eat is that junk food, I think you're old enough to know better now too，and don't you know how to find a boyfriend？”
I chuckled ： „Oh no，what's wrong with being single？"""
She listened more sternly： „Being single is bad，don't use finding a boyfriend as an excuse, always sitting in front of the computer，looks like a slob，who would marry someone like you？"""
I pouted ： „Those guys haven't seen me before，if they saw me they would definitely want to marry me right away。”
「That's true，then you should go home tonight and meet my brother-in-law，I want to see how much he likes you.”
My brother-in-law？I thought for a moment searching my brain, when I was twenty years old he had moved abroad with his son.
When I returned to our long-abandoned house，I opened the freezer and pulled out a bottle of ice-cold soda.
「Eat eat eat，you've only eaten all day.”My mother-in-law began to scold me again： „Wait till the guests arrive，how will you look then？”
Someone rang the doorbell, my dad, who had been busily cooking in the kitchen, came out and opened the door, and it was my brother-in-law，he walked in and praised our food： „Your food smells great.”
My mother-in-law snatched away the soda from me： „Get up，call someone over.”
I obediently stood up ： „Uncle Zhou，hi。”
He smiled and said： 「You're still Rain Yu，you look good，he's definitely my brother's son."""
At this point the door creaked open and a young man, about twenty-seven or eight years old, with a tall face and handsome features came in。
「What are you doing, standing here for so long？"""
The young man walked up to me，stretched out his hand： „Hi，我'm Zhou Yang.”
I shook hands ： „Hi,I'm Qin Rain Yu.”
But just as I was about to pull away he gripped my hand tightly and wouldn't let go。I looked up, only to see him blinking at me 。
Although he was handsome，he seemed a bit superficial。Zhou Yang finally released my hand and began helping dad prepare the meal.
My mother-in-law had been looking forward to this arrangement all day, she managed to seat us together at the table and kept talking about how great he was： „He's a doctor，young，has a good job.”
I just stared blankly eating, suddenly there was more fish in front of me： ``I like fish，don't you？'':
「Thanks。”I politely replied.
「What's wrong？'' Zhou Yang asked curiously,
I turned my head to look at him： ``Nothing，you're just a guest，eat a bit more.”
He looked puzzled for a moment, and then his expression darkened and fell silent again。
At the table，everyone was watching us with curious eyes。If previously translated content is also given, use it as reference.

If you have any translation requests, please let me know. I'll translate the content for you.
If you don't, here's the translation:
 Uncle asked me, "Rain, what do you think of Zhou Yang?":
 "I guess he's okay," I replied honestly. 
My parents looked at each other and burst out laughing. "Yang Yang, what about you?" my aunt asked. 
"Uncle Auntie, I really like Rain." 
I suddenly sat up straight, looking at everyone so casually. "Old brother, don't joke around!"
Rain's voice was stern. "What are you talking about? Be quiet and eat your meal!" Mom's tone was warning me. 
I stuttered, my throat constricted: "Mom, I have someone I like." 
The table fell silent as soon as Rain said that. 
My mom scolded loudly: "Who is it? I didn't know! You've been staying in the apartment all day, you're bound to meet someone!" 
"Paper Person,"
 Everyone was stunned. The side of Zhou Yang's eyes drooped down.
 Dad got up from his seat, frantically trying to break the silence. "Rain, how come you're crying?" 
I wiped my eyes with my hand and couldn't believe I was actually crying. 
The meal ended in a mess because of me. Zhou Yang looked at me before leaving deeply. 
My parents didn't expect me to cry. They sat there quietly without saying anything.
Finally, Mom asked: "Rain, is it because we did something wrong? Or are you really with someone?" 
I shook my head and nodded. 
"You're a tiger from the beginning, always getting into trouble and hard to handle," Dad said. "You were arguing with us for days before, running back and forth between here. We thought you had settled down after that, so we arranged for Yang Yang and you to meet. Maybe Mom didn't think of your feelings." 
I was stunned. Was it really like that? I wasn't there when the incident happened... Is she talking about my character from the novel? 
Is there any way to link our real world with the novel's world?
I shook my head violently: "No, no, no! Don't think about this anymore!"
I couldn't sleep that night. Lao Ge called me again and asked me to consider writing some bonus chapters.
I fell asleep at noon and opened up the website to check on my book. The cover had Rain leaning against the main character's chest, with a huge character "总裁终于后悔了" on the side.
The text read: 
"He, a financial genius who dares to challenge the business world, has an enchanting face that makes countless women swoon. However, he is also extremely possessive and will go to any lengths for his beloved woman!
'Zhang Ye, I love you so much!' 
But the man looked at her with disdain: 'Rain, you're just cheap love. I don't need it.'"
There was a reader's comment below: "Cried! Rain and Zhang Ye are definitely meant to be together." 
I started crying again.If previously translated content is also given, use it as reference.
Combine multiple empty lines in a row into a single one.
The protagonist couldn't help but open the first chapter, second chapter, and so on.
Finally, they reached a familiar scene, but the story was different this time. Rain Violin was being wrongly accused by Zhao Lianbao.
Everything seemed vividly clear, yet it all felt quite off.
Tears welled up in their eyes as they saw a familiar table through a blurry vision. Zhao Lianbao was being overly caring and kind to his lover, asking her if she wanted to go out the next day: "Rain Violin, we haven't gone out in a long time. What do you say? Want to go somewhere fun tomorrow?"
She smiled sweetly back at him, saying, "Let's go to an amusement park. I want to ride the roller coaster."
 Zhao Lianbao raised an eyebrow, asking, "Are you scared?"
Rain Violin replied confidently, "Don't be ridiculous. You're just too young to understand me."
The protagonist watched in stunned silence as a countdown timer on their phone screen appeared: 36:00:00.
What's going on?
They logged out of the novel interface and went back, but the countdown started all over again.
What kind of trick is this?
They decided to wait patiently for the countdown to finish, curious about what was happening.
When they finally returned home, their mom had told them to stay in. They found Zuo Yang waiting at the door, which was unexpected.
"You knew where I lived?"
Zuo Yang just shrugged and said, "I'm a guest. Can't let me sit down."
The protagonist asked him, "What brings you here?"
Zuo Yang replied, "You know, just to hang out."
The protagonist smiled weakly, saying, "Okay, you make a point."
As soon as they walked in, Zuo Yang started going on and on about how messy the room was: "It's not like a girl's room at all. It looks more like a pigsty."
Could they kick him out?
The protagonist gave him a cup of coffee and asked him directly, "What do you want?"
Zuo Yang fell silent for a moment before saying, "You said something about the paper person yesterday."
The protagonist realized that Zuo Yang was asking about Rain Violin.
"I think she's just a virtual character," the protagonist replied. "She doesn't exist."
Zuo Yang looked puzzled and asked, "Is her name Zhao Lianbao?"
This conversation is not clear at all…"I knew you weren't Ruo Yi before."
Don't tell me Zhou Yang had seen Ruo Yi before.
I forced myself to calm down and asked them about what happened between them.
It turned out they met on a rainy day when Zhou Yang didn't bring an umbrella, and Ruo Yi lent him one out of kindness. He was immediately smitten with her and came up with all sorts of excuses to see her again, until they became familiar.
Finally, she told Zhou Yang that she wasn't from this world, at first he didn't believe her, then she said she might return, but now he believes it.
I comforted him by patting his shoulder: "Brother, don't be sad."
"I've read your novel, and after finishing it, I got furious. Zhao Lin Hao is clearly a scumbag, why did he still get happy in the end? It's unfair!"
Me: ".."
He drank six cups of coffee to calm down, but nothing worked, and I had to give him my computer so he could delete that chapter and rant about it online.
Me: ".."
He grabbed my phone quickly and saw the screen, his eyes widened in shock.
02:29:48.
I explained: "This countdown is weird, I thought it was over."
He asked me if I remembered how he entered the book.
After thinking for a moment, he came up with the idea that the trigger for inter-world travel was the finish button on my computer.
That made sense.
I immediately opened my computer and changed the chapter to be published later. However, nothing happened.
I slumped down, but when I looked at my screen again, there were scenes flickering like a game.
I blinked repeatedly to confirm it wasn't just an eye strain,
And there was a countdown below with subtitles!
"Ling: Are you sure about this?
Deng Lian: You don't like Ruo Yi? When she's unconscious, what do you plan to do? It's all up to you."
Ling: I won't hurt her.
Deng Lian pulled out her phone: "Ruo Yi, it's me. Ling. I finally got your contact info and wanted to see you and apologize about the last thing..."
I shivered in disgust, why did all of these villains use such underhanded methods?
This can't be right, it's too low.
I punched my shoulder for emphasis: "Look at this! The villain is at it again!"If previously translated content is also given, use it as reference.
他神情狐疑：「你说什么？让我看什么？」
他满目迷茫，难道这情景只有我能看见？
我继续盯着手机，然而场景却断了。
又过了约莫半小时，屏幕浮现出现赵霆皓坐在办公室的身影。
「赵：冷轩，我觉得这两天雨薇好像有点不对劲，感觉她是雨薇但又好像不是。前天我问她想去哪里玩，她居然说想去游乐园坐过山车.”
“冷：什么？！她不是恐高么！
赵：我在想她是不是忘记自己有恐高症了？
“冷：不可能？我怀疑……”
“赵：怀疑什么？
“冷：我怀疑雨薇有多重人格。
“赵：有可能.”
我：「……”
这个场景结束后屏幕上又只剩下倒计时了。
我把思绪拉回来才发现邹洋在翻箱倒柜找吃的。
原来墙上挂钟的时针都快指到十一点了，怪不得感觉到饿。
锅里咕噜咕噜。
“你就让我吃这个？
“不喜欢螺蛳粉？那正好我还担心不够吃呢！”
“谁说不喜欢了？勉为其难尝两口也不是不可以.”
我呼啦呼啦嗦着粉儿，倒计时只剩二十分钟了。
屏幕上是秦雨薇来到咖啡厅和邓玲依见面。
忽然倒计时开始闪烁，邹洋讶异道：「怎么回事？”
我摇头，继续死盯着屏幕。
眼前秦雨薇拿起面前的水杯想要喝水，我电光火石间急切大喊：「不要喝！！”
然而来不及了。
她好像听见了我说话，终于发现不对劲，却慢慢意识陷入混沌。
于是我看着两个反派把她带去酒店，邓玲依负责脱她衣服，梁林深负责在房间门外望风。
二人关好门走出酒店。
邓玲依拿出手机：赵霆皓吗？我是雨薇老同学，有件事还是觉得告诉你比较好，刚才她和一个男人进酒店了.”
她挂掉电话，露出阴沉的笑。梁：You say Zhao Linghao will believe you?
邓：Men can't stand green hats, especially ones like him who are so tough and iron-handed. Don't bother telling me if it's true or not, but he has to have some feeling left in his heart.
00：00：59。
I feel dizzy, my eyes are blurry, and I faintly hear Qin Yueru's voice saying：「Author, I know you've come, save me please!」
I'm confused, asking her how she knows:
「我 accidentally logged into your author account and found out that I am a character in your novel. I thought the deadline had passed and I could go back, but it didn't happen. It finally happened this time.` 
「Maybe I won't be able to get there。」
「Yes, if I'm not wrong, the countdown is flashing, sometimes at 36 hours, please save me!」
The countdown jumps from 00：00：01 to 00：00：00.
I suddenly fall into darkness.
My head is spinning and feels heavy.
I don't know how long it took for me to wake up, but I see a crystal chandelier in front of me.
I quickly sit up, realizing that I'm not wearing clothes, and look around in fright. I've come back!
Knowing the whole situation, I decide to leave this place as soon as possible. I quickly put on my clothes and open the door, but I freeze at the entrance.
The handsome man who's smoking is standing in front of me, with a cigarette butt scattered all over his feet.
「Linghao……」I barely open my mouth.
He starts laughing, but the smoke chokes him out, causing tears to well up in his eyes：「Rain Yi knows that I was praying for you to come out, not you! 
I grab his hand quickly, saying:
「Linghao, listen to me……」
He shakes off my hand and walks away without looking back.
I realize what's happening too late, so I chase after him, but the elevator door has already closed.
When I'm gasping for air outside the hotel, I see him get into another car and drive away in a cloud of dust.
Rain falls from the sky, and I watch him leave with a heavy heart. My eyes well up with tears as I shout 
「Linghao！Zhang Linghao——」
My high-pitched voice echoes down the street, but he doesn't come back.
I walk aimlessly on the sidewalk, crying in the rain, my hand covering my face to hide my tears.
Suddenly, a black umbrella appears above me, and I turn around, seeing it as if by surprise 
「Linghao！」
 「Rain Yi is me.\"梁林深 reveals a gentleman-like smile.
I'm filled with anger and bite my lip, giving him a punch on the face:
He's surprised and looks at me with curiosity 
 „Rain Yi what's wrong?“I stop by my step：「I know it's you and Dandan Linyi."""
He drops his eyelids：「Sorry."""
“Don't pretend to be a small person, be a real man, let your hair down,” I tell him without any mood for arguing. “After that, he just turns around and walks away.”
Lianglin finally didn’t show up again.
“Pai Daxing, come catch some jellyfish with me! Pai Daxing, come catch some jellyfish with me!” My phone rings out of my bag, and it's Cailing.
“Rainyui, where are you now? Come see us,” he says.
“You’re not studying abroad?” “Actually, I wasn’t.”
”Okay, let’s meet up tonight,”
I hang up the phone and decide to find a place to hide from the rain while also putting off my tears.
I stand under a small alleyway overhang, with raindrops falling in a flowing line. The heavy rain made it difficult to see outside, and the air was filled with mist.
A child passing by clutched a rubber duck toy, shouting at the top of its lungs.
My tears came out even harder.
The rain stopped at night, and I arrived at the restaurant where Cailing and Zhao Yanghao agreed to meet.
Cailing sat with his back against the chair, not facing me.
I approach him, pretending to be casual：“Cold Xing, you're so cowardly. You lied to me about studying abroad for such a long time and never contacted me.”
He puts down his phone at his ear：“Rainyui, you got wet in the rain?”
“I'm just hot, I get cold and tired,”
Honestly, I don’t like Western food, so I only ordered a watermelon salad.
“Did you have a fight with Zhao Yanghao today?”
“No, we just had some misunderstanding.”
“Was it really just a misunderstanding?”
I look at him, seeing his hesitation and doubt：“You know already.”
He nods：“No, but I don’t believe you’re that kind of person.”
I struggle to hold back my emotions：“Thank you, Cold Xing.”
“Rainyui, tell me, what actually happened,”
“I swear it was just a misunderstanding. It’s still confusing now.”
“If you had told me the truth earlier, maybe we wouldn’t have waited until now,”
“I won't lie again if I know you won't believe me.”
If Cailing doesn't trust me too, I might not be able to come back.
“Trust me, Rainyui. I always believed in you.”"This is a misunderstanding, I'm sure of it," she said. "I've seen everything from the start. From Qin Ruoyi being given sleeping pills to being brought to the hotel without even realizing it."
"What...what's going on?!" he asked, looking at her in confusion. "You're not Qin Ruoyi, how can you talk like someone who's watching us?"
"My name is also Qin Ruoyi, but it's not the one you know," she said. "If you don't believe me, then I'm crazy."
She suddenly lost her courage to continue speaking.
Cold Xiang took hold of her trembling hand and breathed deeply before continuing. "Actually, this is a world from a novel. You're all characters in a book, and the author is me. As soon as I finished writing the book and clicked 'finish', I found myself here with Qin Ruoyi again, but only for a few days before I came back. Today, I'm here again."
He was shocked and swallowed hard, touching her forehead. "You're not feverish."
"I knew you wouldn't believe me," she said, feeling lost. "This morning, you talked to Zhao Lingbao about me, thinking I have multiple personalities."
He widened his eyes. "How did you know? Is it really..."
"Story is what I created, so I understand everyone in this world. Because I knew about the scheme that Ronghuan made against Zhao Lingbao and you, so I ran away voluntarily. And I'm also aware of the woman N's tricks, so I switched the files for the new project with fake ones. I know that the male lead's love is destined to be his eternal partner, but I couldn't resist a little bit of greed."
Cold Xiang's face changed from shock to acceptance. "And what about me? What am I in this novel?"
"...... You're the perpetual sidekick who's always pressed down on by the male lead."
He fell silent for a moment, picking up his phone that was lying on the table. "Did you hear that? Zhao Lingbao."
She jumped back in surprise, immediately standing up to leave. Cold Xiang caught her and pleaded with her to wait.
Rethinking her white day, she felt like bone-ticking in her throat.
If he doesn't believe me what am I supposed to do? If he tells me himself to give him back his favorite female lead, how can I endure it?
"Let me go, please," she said, her voice barely above a whisper. "Give me some time."
Cold Xiang saw her crying and was momentarily taken aback before finally letting her go.
She rushed into the night street, walking in the opposite direction of the apartment complex where the hotel is located.
The wet road reflected the colorful lights of the billboards, and she looked up to see the towering Hongbao Group building in front of her.
His group.
She slumped down, feeling aimless as she walked without a destination. Her phone kept ringing with messages from "派大星", calling her to go catch water giants. 
"Mommy, that sister's ringtone is mermaid baby!"
"Yes, little star, you should buy a new phone and set it like that too."
Little boy asked in a soft voice, "Sister why didn't you answer my call? Are you always listening to the sound of mermaid baby?"
She bent down to hug his head. "Yes, little star, I still like Iron Armor Baby."
"Ah, that's the one who transforms into a super-powered mode!" Little boy laughed.
His mom told him, "Alright, let's go home now." 
Little boy walked away, and she felt low again. Suddenly, she heard a familiar voice behind her: "Start super transformation! Start super transformation!"
She turned around, and there was Zhao Lingbao standing in front of her, holding his phone.
Her tears blurred her vision once more.He walked closer and wiped my tears away, "Rain Wei, don't cry."
"I need some time from you," he said, turning his back on me. I wiped my tears, "Are you angry with me? Do you think I've gone crazy?"
He held me tightly, "I'm sorry, I was too scared that you would leave me. The thought of it made me not want to even think about it. Sorry today, I got angry and didn't think clearly before going to check the security footage. Unfortunately, someone deleted the footage."
I took a deep breath, "So how did you know I was wrong?"
"I found someone to restore it,"
"Uh-huh."
"No, that's not what I said." He leaned in close to my nose and his face came right up against mine, making my heart skip a beat.
"Do you think I overheard your conversation with Cold Chen?"
"Yes."
"That means..."
He suddenly covered my lips with his, making the last part of his sentence disappear.
His kiss was just as bossy as he was, no hesitation at all, and soon opened up my mouth to entwine our tongues.
I closed my eyes and wrapped my hands around his waist, starting to blushingly respond to the kiss. Feeling my response, he held me tighter.
"I'm Rain Wei, actually," I said, "Not the one you knew before."
"I already knew that," he looked at me seriously, "I've been noticing it from the start, and I know it wasn't you yesterday either."
"Then do you believe me?"
"No."
My heart sank, "Yes. That was such ridiculous nonsense, I wouldn't have believed it even if it was me."
"You're a fool," he said with a smile, "If you want me to believe you, then just show me the evidence myself."
"Can I get someone's ID as proof?" I asked.
"What, who?"
"I."
He looked surprised, "..."
He suddenly laughed, "Of course it is you. Of course it is. You're that little mischievous one." 
I followed Zhao Glen after work.
Zhou Glen teased me, "You can't even bear to leave me for just one day."
I nodded, "Yes."
He smiled and kissed my forehead.
But he was too happy, I couldn't help but feel down if I'm being honest.Alas, I couldn't take a photo to bring back with me.
Suddenly a brilliant idea struck me: if I sent the CEO's photo on social media, would I still see him when I got back?
To test this incredible idea, I decided to keep taking photos without anyone noticing and finally managed to snap several pictures.
I started choosing photos while facing away from him.
No way, this one is a bit messy.
No way, the lighting isn't right for this one either."
"This one looks okay."
I jumped in fright, my body stiffening as I turned around: "CEO, CEO..."
He smiled and pinched my nose: "Your photography skills are so bad. Every day I see you and still can't take pictures of me? What a hassle! I'm right in front of you, why don't you just take what you want?"
I shivered with cold fear: "...You're really something."
CEO: "...".
My heart sank: every day...
If the social media platform actually allowed posting photos, I would see him every day from now on."
After considering several platforms, I finally chose Zhihu because it has an anonymous feature.
So I posted my earlier stolen photos under a question called "What's it like to have a good-looking boyfriend?":
Not long after, comments started pouring in but they were all negative: if Zhao Lin Hao wasn't lying next to me, I would still believe him anyway.
Me: "..."
I left that post and went to the recommended page, where I saw another question: What is something that seems fine at first but turns out to be illegal?)
I clicked on it and saw a new answer: two of my university classmates got caught for deleting surveillance footage and are now in detention, maybe facing serious prison time.
Wow, this is so serious?! Okay, better safe than sorry, I won't mention anything about that incident again).
To be honest, since yesterday, my mind has been constantly thinking about it. If the CEO and Qin Ruyi were originally a couple but now there's me in between them, am I somehow interfering with their relationship?
Too confusing, feels like I've got a conscience nagging at me. I'm really not sure how to handle this.
Let's see what time it is, I should be heading back tonight. This time, I might not have the courage to come back again if I face him next time.
Looking at Zhao Lin Hao working hard, I felt anxious about seeing him and thought he'd only stay with me because of his ego."
So I spent an afternoon accompanying my mother, visiting Small程, Coldtrack, and Ramen noodles. 
"Ruyi, were you telling the truth? Are you never coming back?" Coldtrack looked surprised.
I nodded: "It's just that I'm a newcomer to this."秦梓涵语气反倒轻松：「走了好走了好，我就说嘛总觉得你不按套路出牌，一点都不好对付。你一走啊，我就又熊熊燃起把霆皓搞到手的信心了！」
她说完又抹了把眼泪：「还有，你回去一定要好好的。」
我心生感动。
她继续说：「记得把我的人设改一下，也安排个女一号给我当当。」
冷轩默默举手：「还有我。」
我：「……」
刚和他们分开我就接到霸总的电话，说下班了。
「好嘞，等我两分钟，我五百米冲刺回去！」
回到公司就看见霸总从办公室出来，我跑过去把大半个身子挂在他身上：「我饿。」
他笑着搂过我：「走吧，回家吃饭。」
华灯初上，五颜六色的灯交替闪烁，车如长龙。车窗外，城市的风景在倒退，微风拂过才惊觉是夏天的气息。
满打满算我来到这边也有一年了。
「雨薇，下周我们出去玩吧。」
我扭头看着他雀跃的眼神不忍拒绝：「好啊。」
他开心得像个孩子：「去哪里玩比较好？你想去哪里？」
我转头望向窗外，任由夏风吹干湿润的眼眶。
我极力忍住哽咽的语气：「嗯……我还没想好。」
「那等你想好了再告诉我，时间限定到下周，抓紧时间哦。」
我说好。
晚上，我窝在床上偷偷抹眼泪，忽然冷轩打来了电话).
「雨薇，你真的想好了吗？」冷轩在劝我，「就不能随时回来看看我？」
「我过不了自己心里那一关。」
「如果你心意已决，我劝你还是把这件事告诉霆皓，要是不想让他一辈子恨你的话。」
「我没有说出来的勇气，不想让他伤心.»
「说到底是男人最了解男人，雨薇你不懂，男人最痛苦的不是伤心而是后悔。听我的话，去说吧。」
「冷轩，谢谢你，你真的好敬业.»
冷轩：「……」
我纠结不已，转眼间就到 36 小时时限了可怎么一点动静都没有？
应该是记错时间了吧。
我来到书房，赵霆皓正拧着眉心看项目资料。===== CONTENT TO TRANSLATE =====
"Glade, I have something to tell you..."

Oh well, I don't have enough courage for this either.

His tightly furrowed brow relaxed and he teased, "Wait for me to take a shower first."
I:「……"

"Not if I ask you a question." I sighed, "If, suppose one day I didn't leave you, how would you feel?"
He suddenly became serious, "Rain, please don't think about that. Please promise me you won't do it."
My tears began to flow without any signs of emotion.
He frantically stood up and wiped my tears with his finger, "You're crying again? Is it because I moved you to laughter or something? Did I really move you?".

I threw my arms around him, "Glade, the truth is, I might leave tonight."
He stiffened up, "Rain, what do you mean?"
"Time will come and go."

He tightly hugged me, "Then I'll hold onto your hand so you won't leave!
I shook my head, "You can't hold me. I think it's been 36 hours before I have to leave. After that, this body of mine will be the destined one for you."
"You're my destiny, don't leave," his tears fell on my shoulder, "Is the 36 hour time frame an exchange time? If so, can you come back after that?"
"Rain." He started whimpering softly, full of pleas, "Can I see you once more? We didn't even plan to go out next week, just one time, please."
I suddenly felt a headache and felt like drowning again.
Time had arrived.

"Zhang Glade, goodbye."
I fell into chaos again.
.......
In the chaos...
I weakly said, "Glade, I'm sorry."

His voice came from afar, "Glade really likes you."
"I'm sorry."
He laughed, "You don't get mad at me? You know my character is meant to be a people-pleaser. Being the main heroine's personality is my duty."
"Rain, thank you..."
I opened my eyes and saw a big smile on Zuo Yang's face.
I was shocked and pushed him away, "What do you want?"
Here is the combined content in English:
"Glade, I have something to tell you..."
Oh well, I don't have enough courage for this either.
His tightly furrowed brow relaxed and he teased, "Wait for me to take a shower first."
I sighed, "If, suppose one day I didn't leave you, how would you feel?"
He became serious, "Rain, please don't think about that. Please promise me you won't do it."
My tears began to flow without any signs of emotion.
He wiped my tears with his finger, "You're crying again? Is it because I moved you to laughter or something? Did I really move you?"
I threw my arms around him, "Glade, the truth is, I might leave tonight."
He stiffened up, "What do you mean?"
"Time will come and go,"
He hugged me tightly, "Then I'll hold onto your hand so you won't leave!"
I shook my head, "You can't hold me. I think it's been 36 hours before I have to leave. After that, this body of mine will be the destined one for you."
"You're my destiny, don't leave," his tears fell on my shoulder, "Is the 36 hour time frame an exchange time? If so, can you come back after that?"
"Rain," He started whimpering softly, full of pleas, "Can I see you once more? We didn't even plan to go out next week, just one time, please."
I felt a headache and felt like drowning again.
Time had arrived.
"Zhang Glade, goodbye."
I fell into chaos again.
"I'm sorry,"
His voice came from afar, "Glade really likes you."
"I'm sorry."
He laughed, "You don't get mad at me? You know my character is meant to be a people-pleaser. Being the main heroine's personality is my duty."
"Rain, thank you..."
I opened my eyes and saw a big smile on Zuo Yang's face.
I was shocked and pushed him away, "What do you want?"He looked dark and gloomy at me: „Is it you?"""
I felt something was off, until I saw his lips quivering wildly and suddenly realized: „What's wrong with your tongue?“
“It got bitten by Rain Vi.”
“I didn't expect you to have a big tongue when speaking, so it makes sense that… ” I was shocked, “You said what?! You kissed someone else! What were you thinking?!”
"I forcefully kissed her."()
I: „…”
He asked me in a unclear tone: “Have you changed partners with her?”
“Only once, and it's only for 24 hours.” I opened my phone and was shocked to find that the countdown timer had passed. 
I remembered what Rain Vi said earlier, she was certain that I would return, and said 36 hours. Could it be that except for those 36 hours, all other time limits ended after they could no longer exchange partners?
Zhou Yang and I were equally concerned so we decided to start living together in my closet by making a new bed on the sofa.
For the next few times of countdown timer that passed, none of them were what I expected. 
I couldn't dare to leave the novel interface anymore so I logged into Zou Yang's phone using his account on Zhidao. 
There is no photo…
My heart was heavy and still didn't sleep well, watching the countdown timer like crazy.
Just a few days passed before the screen finally showed that heart-beating number! 
Sometimes some scenes appear, a miserable CEO, Little Chu who watches animation, or old granny who browses online shopping. 
Time starts flashing, and I fall into darkness again. 
“Actually, I'm a bit hesitant.” Rain Vi said, “Actually, I seem to have developed feelings for Zhou Yang. Oh well, that's fine. Let's not think about it anymore. Tomorrow is the time you're supposed to meet with Glade.”
I sobbed: “Thank you, Rain Vi.”
I woke up in the company hall, when my consciousness gradually cleared away, I heard people all talking loudly around me.
“Hurry up and call the CEO! And hurry and get an ambulance!”
“Just now, I was watching the CEO's wife walk normally for one second, but then she fainted!”
I slowly opened my eyes, surrounded by people. 
“Oh, the president is awake!”
“Thank heaven!”
A staff member helped me up, asking if I had any injuries and should we take you to the hospital? 
I shook my head: “Thanks for your concern.”I feel dizzy.
"Hey, don't be sad!" I took a deep breath and stepped out of my comfort zone to pull him up.
"Are you finally back? I waited for you for 36 hours." He spoke with an excited tone but also had a hint of complaint.
"I'm sorry I was late, don't look down on me like that."
"Who's looking down on whom?" He laughed, "I found the birthday card I gave you."
My eyes welled up with tears: "I'll give you another one too."
"Aha, found it!" he said excitedly, "Lucky I didn't get dirty."
"I'm drying my eyes," I said. "Give me your hand, let's pull each other up."
He said half the words before suddenly falling to the ground with his feet out from under him.
"Glory!"
I felt like I lost all my energy and my legs turned soft.
I kept watching him fall but saw that he landed on a large truck wrapped in burlap."
I ran out of the company when I was in a rush, and by the time I arrived, someone had already pulled over the car.
Glory dropped down from the burlap pile, crawling around with his hands and feet.
I cried as I rushed up to him, tightly hugging him, unable to speak."
He showed me the birthday card: "Look, it's fine. I didn't get hurt."
I burst out laughing: "I knew you had a main character aura that wouldn't easily die."
The truck driver was so scared that he tapped his chest with his hands: "You're lucky I wasn't driving a cone."
I kept apologizing, disturbing the driver, and felt really bad about it.
He handed me the card again: "Here, take this."
He pulled out a black card from his wallet and put it in my palm: "Use it freely."
I said, "This isn't what I meant. This is a birthday card. If you want to see the card, look at me."
He smiled innocently and asked, "Are you hungry?"
The conversation jumped abruptly to food.
"Yes."
"Okay, so let's say that eating is dependent on seeing me. If you see me, then you have to eat me. But if you don't see me, then I should be the one who eats you."
I said, "Okay, but can't we just not eat each other?"
"No, eating me is a necessary condition for eating,"If I didn't eat lunch?
Sorry, there's no if.
I：「……"
I thought Zhao Jianhao would ask me when I was leaving, but he kept quiet and instead asked me where I wanted to go tomorrow.
I was thinking of a few things, so I suggested we go to the beach because we hadn't had as much fun last time.
We made a simple travel plan, and we're going to leave tonight, and by morning we'll be there already. It's worth it just to watch the sunrise.
……
The sea breeze was refreshing, and the sound of waves hitting the rocks on the shore seemed to follow the sea all the way out to the horizon. There was a slight mist in the air that made everything feel smooth and cool.
I and Zhao Jianhao sat side by side on the beach, waiting for the sun to come up over the horizon.
Gradually, finally, it appeared - a huge circle of light that filled the whole sky and made the sea sparkle with golden lights all over the place.
The sunset was completed, and the sea and sky were one color. 
I stood on the beach with my toes exposed, using the morning light to pick up a big pile of shells.
It started to brighten up because it wasn't a holiday, so there weren't many people at the beach - only the occasional manager would show up.
「你 are drawing something?」
I finished the last line of the picture: "naked woman.""
The CEO laughed and got down on his knees: "All of that is covered in shells, it's not really a naked woman."
I giggled: "Do you want me to take them off?"
He raised an eyebrow, scribbling with his hand: "Take them off."
So I took each one off, and when I did, three words appeared on the shell: you, look, what.
The CEO just stared:「……"
I covered my stomach and laughed, he was laughing too: "Don't you remember when you insisted on coming to the beach with me, thinking you were going to see Luo Qing, making me jealous for hours?"
I rolled my eyes: "And don't forget when you got caught by Yang Ruo, looking like you'd had a great time, but ending up dying on that drama chicken."
"Rainy..."
I waved my hand: "Anyway, I wasn't mad back then either.".
"Then what about now?"
"There's still a bit of it." 
"The one thing I'll allow is for you to kiss me,"
My heart jumped again: "Wow, that's so exciting! I'm going to write that in the Dictionary of Broke Men."]
I and he lay down on the beach, looking up at the clear sky with flying seagulls above us, feeling free and happy.
But then I turned my head and saw Zhao Jianhao staring straight at me.```
"What are you doing?"
"I'm afraid you'll leave suddenly."
I forced a smile and said, "Before you leave, won't you tell me?"
He looked shocked and asked, "Are you leaving now?"
"Uh... If it's about time, I'd say at the earliest today, if not then I don't know."
I shifted my position to snuggle closer to him, "This time, after you're gone, I'll never go back again."
He remained silent, and I looked up to see his eyes red from crying.
"I comforted him,"
"CEO, I'm not this world's person; in the world where I exist, I have friends and family who love me. Once I return, I won't feel lonely."
"The CEO will make sure you're not lonely."
I shook my head, "You're the main character of Rain Violet, not mine. If we were to fight over it, my conscience would never be at peace."
He took a few deep breaths and asked if I was hungry.
I nodded.
After dinner, the sky turned dark with a gentle breeze, and the tide began to rise. A massive blue-violet light appeared in the sea, "Wow! Sea Sparkles!"
The light moved with the rising tide, and as it did, it seemed to be moving on its own.
I couldn't help but sigh, "I wish I could commit this beautiful moment to memory."
In the fading light, Zhao Lin Hao whispered, "Yes, it's a moment worth remembering."
"Exactly!" I turned around, only to see he was looking at me instead of the sea.
I stood next to him by the sea, feeling the wind blowing through my dress and hair.
The sky had completely darkened, and night fell heavy.
Suddenly, my head began to ache.
I managed to grasp Zhao Lin Hao's hand with my last bit of consciousness, "CEO, I'm going."
A sense of drowning washed over me, and Qin Rain Violet's voice echoed in my ears, "Can you hear the author? What are we supposed to do? The author interface is weird, and there's a 'Entering Sleep Mode' warning at the bottom. The countdown for entering sleep mode moves quickly!"
"What?!"
"We might not have had time to talk again."
Sleep mode... I was doomed!
I took a moment to collect my thoughts and then said with a heavy tone, "No, this time... Maybe we won't be able to exchange numbers again."
The silence was deafening.
"Rain Violet,"
"I need you to take care of my parents. Please,"
"The author trusts you. I'll take good care of them. This is the happiest moment in my life, and I want to continue being their daughter. I've never felt this way before."

```Thank you, thank you!
 Author, are you happy and brave ...
Her soothing voice suddenly stopped.
The sound of ocean waves was by her ears.
I opened my eyes and saw Zhao Linbao holding me, crying like a child.
「Rain Xi, come back to me, I miss you so much, waaah。」
I chuckled and said, "Boss, your lower lip is out."

He heard this and his tearful eyes lit up with excitement again:“You, you, you…”。
"I'm fine, what's wrong?" 
He became very excited and hugged me tightly:“You didn't leave!”."
“I left because I have to fight for the people,”.
"Who are you fighting against?"

"You're just a troublemaker, and I don't want you to hurt other girls,"
"Alright, from now on, I'll only harm you,"
"Aren't we going to talk about that wedding contract? Forget it!" 

“Forget what?” 
“I want to tell you again the story of the white swan and the little duck.”

Translation of hot search topic:
“ Zhao Linbao is getting married again” this topic was trending on microblog for three whole days, with a huge discussion.
I don't get why he's so excited about marrying, it feels weird to me. So I suggested him spend some money to make the topic go viral.
He agreed quickly, and called his secretary in, telling her to buy the topic immediately.

Me: “…”
This boss always doesn't understand or is pretending not to understand 

I opened microblog and found that people's comments were getting out of hand: “is he having an affair again?” “Is he having a second wife?” [doge]
I played with my heart, using a small account to reply: I'm the one, wait for 5 minutes, post my own photo over here!
Translation endedI received a response quickly: I'm not Zhao Bao, though.
I laughed out loud, this netizen has some interest.
Suddenly, I felt a chill down my back, I stopped laughing and turned around to look at Zhao Lin Hao, who was staring at me with an angry face.
Me: "I just wanted you to pay for the hot search, I didn't mean it like that."
He ignored me and turned his head to talk to the female secretary: "Make them send me the number one rated review to me."
"Boss, you're being unreasonable, I was just joking with this netizen, please don't get angry."
He didn't say anything.
I asked: "How will you compensate me?"
He said: "I want you to let me have half a day's freedom."
"Half a day? What am I supposed to do?"
"Say."
"I'll give you the money, but only if you agree to go with me to try on wedding clothes."
He spit out an expression of disgust: "Don't you dare. I won't marry someone who is not worthy of my wealth."
"Half a day? You want to go where?"
"There's a ten billion dollar project."
"I and ten billion, who's more important?"
He paused for a moment: "Of course, you're more important."
I waved my hand dismissively: "Ten billion is more important."
A woman with good manners will never stop her husband from making money.
I've always thought that driving while talking on the phone is very dangerous, but Zhao Lin Hao's mother was doing it right next to me).
"Glory Hao, why didn't you come with your wife to try on wedding clothes? I told you if Rain Vi today meets a handsome guy, I'll let her marry someone else! You'll regret it later."
I held my breath, reminding him: "Mom, can we stop the car and talk on the phone?"
I looked at the pedals of the car, which were almost at 150, and then at the wet pavement, my heart skipped a beat.
It's best to go get my driver's license someday, at least it will keep my life in my own hands.......
I walked into the wedding dress store with a floaty gait, but I still felt like I was sitting in the car。
The shopkeeper greeted me enthusiastically: "Zhang Zhao, we have prepared a beautiful wedding dress designed by an Italian famous designer just for you."
I was confused: "I don't remember booking a wedding dress."
"Me."
He smiled with a smile that was hard to hide: "I lied to them, I actually came here before and couldn't find any design I liked, so I made my own decision."
Wait a minute, is Zhao Hao a mom's boy?
Just then, I received a message from my grandma on WeChat: Rain Vi, look at these dress pictures, see which one you like, my grandmother-in-law makes them in our village, they're warm and beautiful."
And here are twelve pictures, none of which were anything but northeast-style flower patterns and thick cotton cloaks, with a big red auspicious character on the headscarf, it was dazzling to my eyes!
Here is the translated content.I want to say, Grandma, you have air conditioning, and it's not cold...
The ruthless mother-in-law had a premonitory expression on her face: "I was just preparing myself for Old Lady's one hand..."
She then had a pitiful look on her face: "I was taken in by such an advantage when I was young..."
I quickly grabbed her hand, expressing gratitude with tears of joy: "Thank you, Mom!"
It can be said that the ruthless mother-in-law has great insight, this wedding dress is indeed beautiful and elegant, not losing its playful charm and matureness.
I like it! I really like it!
"Mom, help me take a picture to send to Tianbao."
She said with a voice: "Don't take it, who would even look at the beautiful daughter-in-law when nobody is here? No way!"
So before the wedding, Zhao Tianbao never got to see me in my wedding dress.
"Rainy, congratulations on your marriage." Cold Chun said over the phone.
"Thanks, but you'll be there for the wedding?"
"I'm sorry, I've already left the country."
"You're where? I'm going to look for you now!"
"What line do I need to take? How many bus routes should I take?"
He sighed and said: "Line 2, turn on route 9, remember to get off the subway after you land, go straight to the opposite side of the street and catch a bus. Two stops later, you'll see a children's amusement park, that's where I am outside a small food stall. Don't forget to bring money, or the owner will keep it from me."
"You don't pay by phone?"
"My dad froze my money."
「……"
I arrived at the children's amusement park and helped Cold Chun pay for the ticket, then he led me to the fairy tale castle.
Today the weather dropped to an incredible low, we sat outside on a bench under the wind, which made me feel dizzy.
He put his hat on top of mine: "Is it warm enough?"
I nodded.
"Do you know why it's so warm?"
He didn't wait for my answer and said: "Because I was thinking about you just now, and I called you out. This is the hat that I like most, if I give it to you, it will be like a gift from me alone."
I felt touched: "Cold Chun, you'll find your own lucky..."
"Okay, so what about the food money? Can't I not pay it back?"
「……"
We both jumped in surprise when Zhao Tianbao suddenly appeared.
Good grief, he came.He walked in with two long legs, without hesitation, sat down between me and Luo Cheng, forcibly separating us. He then scornfully took off my hat from Luo Cheng's head, and took off his own thick coat to wrap around me from head to toe.
"You know how I got here? Are you just following me by road?"
"Following can be used but is the word not replaceable?"
"So you were chasing after me with a rabbit-like and blind-like tail?"
" Zhao Bao Hao:「……""
He didn't argue with me, turned around and asked Luo Cheng when he could really get out on his own, if he could help him pay for the ticket.
Luo Cheng refused, saying he didn't want to pay for the ticket, but Zhao Bao Hao offered to use the money from earlier snacks to compensate.
Zhao Bao Hao cut through with a knife: "Thought it was beautiful."
Luo Cheng snorted and said: "Wait until I have more money, I will return to you tenfold!"
"I'm not a good person, the interest is charged every penny every second."
Luo Cheng trembled and pointed his finger at him: "Thief, thief!"
I always thought their relationship was strange.
They're friends but often can't stand each other. They say they're not friends but help each other out in critical situations.
It's finally the wedding day, all major media reporters are gathered with cameras taking over the entire street, even opening a live broadcast mode.
In the dressing room, Zhao Bao Hao insisted I couldn't wear this dress because it was too revealing.
I didn't want to listen and held still without changing.
He eventually relented saying that wearing the dress would be fine, but needed something to cover up in front.
But our wedding dress designer had designed it specifically for low back so adding something artificial would ruin its aesthetic appeal!
Luo Cheng subtly suggested: "Why don't we just change to another one, quickly?"
"Okay……" I said as I couldn't help sneaking a peek at him, but he was too polite and could only be gentle.
"My wife."
He didn't expect me to call him that, his face turned bright red and he froze: "Huh?"
"I like this dress."
「……".
"We have to show off the wedding dress we designed."
「……That's fine then."
By now the reporters had set up their cameras, ready for our arrival.
"Our audience friends are here at the luxurious hotel of弘皓 Group in Y city, witnessing what is being called a 'novel-level' marriage by netizens of Zhao Bao Hao, the ruthless CEO, who will be getting married again today……! They're here!
As the camera moves, the bride and groom appear on screen.
But why was this so weird…..I walked with a suppressed laugh, "Mr. CEO, Mr. CEO", and I didn't expect you to be like this today.
I tilted my head at him, and all I saw was his awkward and serious expression, his muscular chest under the low-cut wedding dress, which was too small and only had half of the zipper closed.
He struggled to walk towards me with a big skirt dragging behind him, while I wore a much larger size than mine new groom's suit holding his hand.
Zhang Bao Luo is taller by one head than me, but he looked like he was struggling to get into that wedding dress which was too small for me, and somehow managed to pull it off perfectly.
"Ah!" I whispered softly.
"What's wrong?" he asked me.
"I forgot to shave your legs,"
"..."
This wedding ceremony took over the front page of all major news outlets.
News One: "Surprise! Zhao Bao Luo is actually a fashion icon for women's clothing?"
News Two: "Why did you have to do this?"
News Three: "Zhao Bao Luo: I didn't expect it, I just wanted to experience the feeling of wearing a wedding dress again."
This CEO was now exchanging rings with me.
The announcer declared, "Now the groom can kiss the bride."
He looked at me and my hands climbed up his neck, he looked surprised, I smiled brightly, and I stood on tiptoes and initiated a kiss.
The audience erupted in applause like thunder.
I let go of him, and saw that his eyes were still closed when they slowly opened, so soft and gentle.
I asked him, "Do you know why I initiated the kiss?"
He shook his head.
"Because my new groom's suit is mine,"
......
Finally, I could rest now. I fell onto the couch.
This day was exhausting me, I woke up at 6:00 am and was busy all day long.
I picked up my phone, and to my surprise, there were over ten push notifications, all about the wedding ceremony, including a full video version.
I opened it curiously, and oh boy, the comments directly filled up the screen.
Netizen One: "This man's physique is amazing!"
Netizen Two: "Oh, I love him so much!"
Netizen Three: "Girls, I want to possess this man's soul!!"
Netizen Four: "The way he looked at the bride was too condescending for me," crying.
Netizen Five: "That warm smile of his when he kissed the bride is too much! awsl!"If previously translated content is also given, use it as reference.

===== CONTENT TO TRANSLATE =====
I couldn't help but curve up my mouth, the CEO of the brilliant empire still isn't going to spoil his wife by dressing her up in dresses.
Suddenly someone flooded my WeChat, and I opened it to find a message from a classmate I hadn't contacted for a long time, morning Lily.
Morning Lily: Rainy sister, your husband, oh not, your ex-husband is the CEO of弘皓 group? [Surprise] He got married again today!
I: He's not my ex-husband...
Morning Lily: What? Isn't he your ex-husband? Maybe you're his... package deal?
I: You don't think I'm beautiful anymore? 
「Sister。」
Xiao Cheng poked his head out from the doorway, still holding a pile of sweet treats.
Next, Zhao Tianhao walked in behind him, looking unhappy: „He's really coming, oh well, we're wasting our time doing important things.”
Xiao Cheng innocently asked: „What's so important?''
The CEO, with a child by his side, didn't have any secrets: „It's nothing, it's just kids' stuff."
He rushed over to me, dropping the things in my hands and spilling them everywhere, like he was offering gifts. He handed me a candy: „Sister, eat this, it's delicious!
「What about that?'' I couldn't resist anymore, taking the chocolate cake I had been eyeing for so long: „If it tastes good, then sister will eat it, okay?
He shook his head: „It's too sweet, it made me drink a lot of water. Sister, don't buy this next time.
The CEO immediately scolded him sternly: „Don't say that! There won't be another time!
Xiao Cheng was shocked and slumped down, looking at me with tears in his eyes.
I quickly hugged him: „Tianhao, Xiao Cheng is just a kid, don't scare anyone!
「Is he your kid?'' Zhao Tianhao's sister asked from behind us.
```
Bring him away!''
She smiled: „The boy's spirit is still young, it's too early for that.''**霸总:**「……"
小程扑到我怀里，说想玩玩具.

霸总姐姐犹豫须臾，才说有话要和赵霆皓说，让我带小程去玩.
估计时间差不多了，我回来时，姐正好要走了.

她临走前还对我们意味深长眨眨眼：「今晚加油！」

**我:**「……"
………
我最近迷恋上了一档练习生节目，节目中的小帅哥长相都很戳，我疯狂保存他们的照片.

赵霆皓目光幽怨地看着我：「你喜欢这样的？」
「当然啦，周骁瑞小哥哥是这届练习生里最好看的了！你看人长得这鼻子这眼儿，简直太戳我审美了！」

霸总撇嘴：「娘了吧唧的，不好看。」

我切了一声，继续给梓涵安利这个宝藏男孩.

就在我俩隔着屏幕发出土拨鼠尖叫时，梓涵的头像从自己的照片换成了周骁瑞。
我也不甘示弱，花了半个小时把我和周骁瑞 p 在一起，并配文：新交的男朋友太黏人怎么办？在线等，急！[doge]
梓涵：既然是情敌，那就拔刀吧！
冷轩：这人和我有点儿像诶[思考]，不过你把赵霆皓那逼屏蔽了吗？
啊呀，太激动，把这么重要的事给忘了！
**我:** （颤抖）呜呜呜，霸总，你要对我家小哥哥干什么？
不过霸总啥时候对综艺投资感兴趣了？公司的娱乐大头不是影视么？
**记者：**请问赵总为何决定投资综艺呢？
**赵霆皓：**因为我太太喜欢。

至此，宠妻狂魔霸道总裁这个人设又被拔高了。
………
秦梓涵不知从哪里搞到两张练习生节目观众票，约我一起去 .
第一排不愧是最佳观众席，就连主持人鼻尖上的痘痘都看得一清二 clearing。

每出来一位练习生，观众都疯狂尖叫，好不容易等到周骁瑞出来，我激动得一阵狂叫，举着灯牌使劲摇晃，都快把座椅晃散架了。
旁边梓涵比我更夸张，居然像老母亲似的眼泛泪花：「多好的孩子啊！」
**我：**有些讶异，莫非不是女友粉而是妈妈粉？Who knew that the next second she would clenched her fists and looked resolute, "I'm going to think of a way to get him into my hands!"
Me:「……"
The audience was in an uproar in the studio, the screaming from the audience was even more painful than the bouncy castle.
Halfway through the program, the host suddenly announced that as a thank you to fans' enthusiasm, they would randomly select one lucky fan and their favorite idol for an interaction.
The selection method was not traditional on a big screen, but by idols behind a blindfold spinning around and throwing "embroidered balls." 
I couldn't expect it anymore, I ended up receiving Zheya's embroidered ball!
I jumped up and down with excitement, Ramda repeatedly whispering in my ear, "Sister, please get his WeChat number, please get his WeChat number!"
"I'll try it out."
Getting your idol's WeChat number was hard though.
I jumped onto the stage, my heart racing wildly standing next to Zheya.
"Hello." He shook hands with me.
I couldn't believe I was rubbing my sweaty palms all over myself, "Hello hello."
At this moment, the host suddenly raised his voice, "Audience friends, today your ticket price was worth it! You absolutely won't be able to imagine who's going to come out next!"
What kind of guest is that?
"He's been hosting for so long, every time he thinks about talking to him, I get a little nervous." The host took a deep breath and, "Okay, let's welcome the heavyweight guest, Zhao Tianhao, Zhao Chairman!"
I was shocked until my head was going to fall off. He was always busy, why did he have time to participate in this show?
The audience below Ramda looked just as surprised, with a worried expression watching me.
The audience shouted loudly, "Old man, old man!
I had tears streaming down my face, "Old man, I can quit being the lucky fan if you want."
I hung my head low and felt a crushing weight, then saw two shiny black boots standing next to me.
The stage was so big, couldn't he stand somewhere else?
Host: "Zhao Chairman, what do you have to say about this stage?"
He took his time speaking, "I'm not commenting on the stage, but I want to comment on someone."
He stopped there, I took a deep breath and looked up, only to see him staring at me with a fixed gaze: "You really are incredibly lucky!"
I swallowed hard: "Actually, I'm not very lucky either..." 
The audience below Ramda hid behind their phone screens.
Then Zhao Tianhao was arranged to sit on the guest seat, which put him directly in front of me.
This segment ended and we continued with the interaction game. 
It wasn't that difficult.
Here is the translated content in English:But seriously, how did he even get into this scene of confessing love?
And to think that it was a key line "Baby I like you".
The empire's expression immediately changed to one of distress, perhaps even risking to flip over the entire broadcast hall.
I trembled with fear, my brain went blank, and I dared to sneak a peek at the emperor only to see him staring at me with his piercing eyes that could pierce through a screen.
Zuo Rui saw no reason to waste time finishing the task so he just blurted out "Baby I like you."
Me: "...Thanks for this old man's affection."
Zuo Rui: ""
I had no idea what we would say next, and I was dumbfounded and completed the game task without thinking.
Zhao Lin Hao sat there with his legs crossed, looking at me with a mix of joy and sadness that I couldn't tell which one it was.
Ran Heng whispered "WeChat, WeChat" to me.
What's the point of even asking for WeChat in this situation?
The host: "Alright, thank you very much for participating in the show, is there anything else you'd like to say?"
I pinched my lip and spoke awkwardly: "Big brother, can I get your WeChat number?"
The audience erupted into cheers again, with some people shouting "Don't give it! Don't give it!"
Zuo Rui looked uneasy, and I suddenly had an idea: "It's not me who wants it, it's him."
I pointed my finger at Zhao Lin Hao: "He wanted it." Then, with a bold gaze, I gave him a look that said "Are you sure?".
Zhao Lin Hao froze for half a minute, with Zuo Rui and the host looking at each other in confusion.
He rubbed his forehead again, still smiling: "Give it to her, give it to her."
We finally made it through the show, and when the time came for the best moment of the day award, Zuo Rui's votes were a landslide lead that left no one in doubt.
According to tradition, we had to have a guest speaker.
Zhao Lin Hao's voice was laced with subtle mockery: "The idol got first place. Are you happy now? Hmm?"
He emphasized the word "helped" which made me giggle nervously: "Happy…"
What everyone expected next was Zuo Rui to tear up on live TV, but what happened instead was that he started crying uncontrollably: "I didn't expect Zhao General to be my fan. I... I don't deserve it at all!"
The emperor: ""
This show has undoubtedly made the top trending topic again.
But surprisingly, the hot comments were going in a different direction:霸道高冷总裁 x 呆萌可爱练习生 (The cold and powerful CEO falls for an adorable trainee).
I was so caught up that I started writing millions of words just before finishing it.If previously translated content is also given, use it as reference.
Combine multiple empty lines in a row into a single one.
周骁瑞脸色绯红，又惊又恐，抿唇不说话。赵霆皓猛地把唇覆上去：『我要让你染上我的味道，宝贝，你是逃不掉的！』
周骁瑞别过脸去，露出楚楚可怜的神情，赵霆皓捏住他的下巴把他的脸扳正，挑眉邪肆道……
此时霸总应该说什么才符合剧情呢？
「小东西，你这是在引人犯罪。」
「好，这句台词好！」我忍不住拍案叫绝。
只是这声音……
我僵硬扭过头去，发现霸总不知什么时候坐到我旁边，假笑道：「写啊，怎么不写了？」
我悻悻摇头：「不，不写了……」
「我觉得你文笔蛮不错，画面感也挺强的呢！」
啊啊啊，霸总要杀人啦，谁来救救我？！
我起身想逃，他仗着自己力气大，硬是搂住我的腰不让我动弹：「要不我们现在去房间实践实践你刚才写的画面？」
「啊不，不用。」
妈呀，实在太羞耻了，我立即转移了话题。
「核桃，对，我刚才看见李妈买了些核桃回来，我去拿点儿来吃。」
他这才放开我，我头也不敢回地跑去厨房。
蹲在门后悄悄看他，只见他接了个电话就开车去公司了。
虽然一开始并不是真的想吃核桃，但还是禁不住又大又圆的核桃的诱惑。
只是找了半天没找见锤子。
用牙咬吗？不行，我又不是纪晓岚。
用门压吗？不行，门要掉漆。
不过砸核桃不一定非要用锤子，用别的东西也成啊。
我找了半天，被霸总随意放在桌上的手表吸引了。
他有几大抽屉的表，我用一个应该不过分吧？
还别说，这手表真结实，是砸核桃的好工具，才两分钟就砸开七八个了。
「霆皓啊，赵霆皓。」冷轩捏着 20 块钱，雄赳赳气昂昂地走进来，「我来还你小吃钱了，别说我还不起啊.»
«他去公司了.»我说着便示意他过来吃核桃。
他也不客气，一口气把我砸的核桃全吃光了. 
我把砸核桃的工具递给他，想让他砸.
他看着遍布疮痕的手表，略微一愣，哆嗦着双手捧接过去：「我滴个乖乖，赵霆皓可真够宠你的.»
«什么意思？»我问."Is this watch not what he gave you to crack open nuts with?"
I shook my head, "No, I couldn't find a hammer and it was just lying there."
Cold Xuan sympathetically patted me on the shoulder, saying I must have died.
It turns out this watch is a limited edition released this year, and only two were produced in the world. One of them was locked away in the safe, while the other one was this one, which Zhao Lin Hao spent 20 million to buy.
I felt a cold sweat on my back, my neck hairs stood up, and I couldn't help but ask Cold Xuan how to deal with it.
Cold Xuan suggested that I hide the watch, saying maybe after some time, Zhao Lin Hao would forget its existence.
When I was thinking about where to hide the watch, the CEO suddenly called, asking me to bring him the table watch. He forgot to wear one.
I hung up the phone and sat down on the desk with a sigh of embarrassment. Cold Xuan saw my face and filled it with sympathy.
I kept organizing my thoughts all the way here, but I didn't realize until now that I was at the CEO's office, when I heard that Zhao Lin Hao had just sent out a huge message earlier.
This time, I made a classic mistake by going to throw myself in front of the gun.
I shook off my nervousness and pushed open the door with the CEO's office. Smiling, I said, "Honey."
"You're here. Where's your watch?"
I hastily put my back against my shoulder, saying "You only care about it because it's expensive, right?"
The CEO replied, "Of course I don't. Although it is very expensive."
He opened his hand and said, "Take it."
I wiped the sweat off my forehead, trying to calm down, and said, "This watch doesn't feel solid at all. If I just drop it a little, it'll break. Oh dear, oh dear..."
The CEO paused for a moment, as if he had noticed something.
"Give me it," he said, "I think I can handle it."
I trembled like leaves and tightly put the watch in my palm to hand it over to him, saying "If only I had saved it earlier..."
"Qin, Rui, Xiaoyi!!"
I instinctively ducked down, closed my eyes, and whispered.
He gently poked at my earlobe with his finger, saying "Tell you honestly, was it really dropped?"
I nodded.
"It wasn't. It fell from the table onto a nut, breaking it."
I stared blankly at him, unable to believe it.
"How did you know?"
"Scars," he said, "And also, why didn't you see any nut crumbs stuck on the watch face? You're stupid."
He sighed and laughed, saying "Two million dollars' watch. How will I make up for it?"
I replied, "Next year's Double Eleven, I'll grab a watch online for you."
He shook his head, "No way."
Where am I supposed to go now to get you another watch?
"Is there such thing as a genius watch phone, though?"
The CEO: "...Not now."「好，把手给我。」
Upon that, I spent half a minute holding his wrist and drew a fake watch face on the spot.
He looked at the fake watch he just drew and burst out laughing, saying, 「So what do I need to smash cashews with you anymore?」
「我 will never eat cashews again...»
He successfully calmed down the CEO, and I felt incredibly light-hearted as if the whole sky had opened up.
Suddenly, a subordinate grabbed my arm and asked me to accompany her to the CEO's office, saying she wanted to show him a new proposal plan. She was terrified.
For the sake of the subordinate's mental health, I decided to remind the CEO again.

Another green tea:
The Escape: Please Keep Him Away from You
View details
11.
「有什么要买的让李妈他们出来买就行了！」
Yesterday's work ended at 2am, and now he's pulling me up early again. The CEO is definitely not happy about this.
I pouted at him, 「Is it because you got me? You don't even bother to ask me out on a date?"""
Oh no, it seems like the best way to keep him from getting too close to me is still to be someone he can never have.
He was taken aback, „Date?"""
「Against all odds, we should go on a date!」
Last time I went shopping with him, I got abducted. But this time, since he's here, I feel completely safe.
I almost ate every single thing at the street food stalls, including stinky tofu, roasted cold skin, and spicy chicken claws.
My belly was full to satisfaction, and Zhao Lin Hao handed me a tissue from my bag and wiped away my tears, saying, „Were you happy? You've been eating all day, it's not good for your health at all."""
As we left the bustling street food market on Big Road, the cold wind blew strongly, making me shiver.
I tightened my clothes and wrapped my arms around myself to keep warm.
Suddenly, I felt a warm feeling covering my body. It was Zhao Lin Hao who had put his black high-neck sweater over me.
I hastily took off his sweater, saying, „I'm not that fragile. Even in this cold weather, it's impossible for you to keep warm with just one sweater."""
He smiled warmly, saying, „Rainflower, you care about me."""
「No way! I was just trying to get rid of the stupid sweater anyway. Why did you put it on me?""
I said that and quickly took back his handbag, rushing forward.
He caught up with me and wrapped his arms around me again, saying, „Are you embarrassed?"""
„What's there to be embarrassed about?! You didn't even offer!""
He burst out laughing without saying anything else after that.What's going on?
I bend down to take a closer look and get startled, my heart racing with anxiety.
Mom, what's wrong with that metal buckle? When did it get tangled up with the boss's suit jacket? And why did it come loose?
The black thread is swaying in the wind, forming a beautiful landscape between Zhao Limeng's face and his bag. 
I'm so desperate to pull out the thread from the metal buckle, but every time I try, more threads are pulled out of the jacket!
This outfit looks ridiculously expensive, don't you think? Is it over a hundred million or maybe even billion? 
Yesterday I broke a 2 million watch, today if I mess up my tie again, even Zhao Limeng's temper won't be able to hide his anger. 
I quietly follow behind the boss, trying not to draw attention to myself as I observe his expressions, and he doesn't seem to have noticed anything unusual yet.
Okay, stay calm, stay calm... 
Right now all I can think of is finding a way to cut the thread.
I'm dragging my heart along with me, silently praying that I won't get caught. 
But the quality of this thread is ridiculous! Even after using nine lives and two tigers' effort, it's still not cut, and I've even pulled on my hand too!
I re-examine the metal buckle and see the threads all tangled up, making it impossible to untie.
What am I supposed to do? 
「Rain, if we're meeting here today, shall we go watch a movie afterwards?」
I hastily respond, "Okay, okay!" 
Suddenly I get a feeling that he's going to turn back and look at me, so I quickly move to his left side and put my bag away, blocking his view. 
And indeed he does! 
I'm terrified but relieved when he doesn't notice the problem with the tie again: "Which type of movie are you in the mood for? 
I don't have the heart to think about it right now; I just say whatever comes to mind: "Romantic comedies." 
Are you kidding me?! Don't we need to make a decision?! 
That's when I quietly move away, still worrying about the tangled threads, when suddenly there's a loud rumbling sound of motorcycles coming from behind me.
Before I can react, my bag is snatched by someone sitting on a motorcycle behind me. 
Oh no!Black threads danced around his movements, forming a more beautiful scenery line.......
The general's jacket was being taken off at an eye-catching speed, one circle after another.
Gradually, his waist and abdomen appeared, followed by his abs....
I finally realized that someone was taking advantage of their good physique without wearing a coat.
Passersby were all shocked by the stunning scene before them.
Uh... I'm so embarrassing, if I were the general, I would have gone underground to dig up Line 7 station by now....
I quickly lifted my hand to cover his abs, laughing and saying, "Abdomen cold? Don't worry, I'll cover you up."
I didn't dare look up at him, only clinging to my own heart, trembling with hands to help him cover. In my heart was a nosebleed and tears, now I'm going to get scolded by the general....
He was furious to the point that his arms were bulging with veins.
The jacket continued to be taken off in circles, only after one blink of an eye, his well-toned chest was exposed in the air....
I quickly took out another hand to cover his chest muscles. However, I could only cover one side....
I gathered my courage and said, "General, can you cover the other side?"
He was so furious that his whole body was shaking, according to my experience, this should be on the verge of explosion....
Estimating that his anger had already reached a boiling point, I was preparing myself for him to leave, but he surprisingly grabbed the thread and wrapped it around his wrist several times, pulling it back quickly....
Crash....
I looked up following the sound and saw the horrific scene before me....
The motorcycle stopped in mid-air and then fell onto its side, the two men who were trying to steal bags lay on the ground, screaming in pain....
Due to their excitement while grabbing the bag, they got tangled up with the thread, which wrapped them together....
Since the car was already a distance away, I thought about going to pick up the bag again, but then I remembered that the general was currently standing exposed in the cold wind....

People on the street were all staring at Zhao Lin Hao's figure, occasionally some girls would let out a low cry....
I carefully lifted my head and saw that only his neck and shoulder strap were left of the general's jacket, which looked like a dog collar....
I nervously swallowed and spoke in a calculated tone, "I want to go pick up the bag, but I also need to cover you up, what should we do?"
Zhao Lin Hao's face was as white as marble, "Clothes."
"Ah?"
"You forgot to give me my clothes back!" he finally couldn't hold it in and roared at me, his anger beyond control...
"Oh, okay, I forgot."
I quickly removed his outerwear and wrapped the exposed skin with care, even not daring to look at him again, just quietly ran away to pick up the bag....
"Brother, you would steal from me anyway, but why are you so angry now?" I knelt down next to the two men who were crying in pain, "This is bad, not only will we both be scolded, but you'll get hurt too..."
One of them complained, "I wasn't going to steal from you, although it looks like it's worth something, I'd rather steal your neighbor over there."
I:「……"Even when facing death, my mouth was still hard.
Just as I was lamenting this fate, a police officer happened to pass by and arrested the two thieves.
Since the two were tangled up like glutinous rice, it took some pressure from the police uncle to get them to take tiny steps with their legs.
I crouched down there, my head hung in despair, wondering how to deal with Zhao Lin Hao's furious expression.
Suddenly, footsteps as if of a "god of death" approached, getting closer and closer...
I immediately grabbed onto Zhao Lin Hao's leg: "Oh no, boss! Don't be angry. I didn't know what that thing was made of. I was going to..."
He cut me off: "Rain Veil." His tone was surprisingly calm, with not a hint of anger.
"Ah?" I looked up at him, and for some reason, I couldn't react right away. However, from his expression, it seemed like he wasn't even angry anymore.
I quietly calmed down my own heart, but then saw that he had two terrifying scratches on his hands!
"Boss, you're hurt!"
He nonchalantly replied: "The scratch I got when I pulled out the string. Don't worry about it."
I held onto his hand: "Where's the wound? It's bleeding so much! Let's go to the hospital and patch it up right away."
Just then, he received a private doctor's phone call.
It turned out that he had an annual examination tomorrow.
What blood tests? Urine tests? Those I wasn't even going to bother with).
But poop tests? Ugh, I didn't want to do that at all!
I had been sitting in this pit for so long, putting in a lot of effort, sweating a ton, but still nothing happened.
So I asked the boss: "Old man, are you done yet?"
"I've taken care of it. You'll be there soon." 
"Hey, can I borrow some poop from you? Mine just came out really clean this morning and I don't know how to get any more out,"
「……"
"Oh, okay. Just a little spoonful will do. Don't worry if you're worried, I'll give it back to you tomorrow."
「……can I have that?"
After getting done with these things, we returned home as the sun began to set.
I opened my phone and saw a news post: "Bullish CEO Zhao Lin Hao Caught the Flying Car Bandit!"
The headline read: "Zhao Lin Hao Caught the Flying Car Bandit. Police are ecstatic: Y City Good Citizen likes Zhao CEO's post!"
Below that was my hasty photo of his muscles, which was blurry and easily recognizable as a selfie.
Comments started blowing up:
"For Zhao CEO, good job!" - low bee
"Hey, you're so cool! @Zhao Lin Hao, bro, do you have any fitness secrets to share?" - hothearted fan
Commenters started going wild:

Caught off guard
Escape Diary: Please Keep a Distance from My Boss
View details
Eleven, caught off guard
For participating in dinner I was very active, which resulted in me arriving two hours early.
Not long after I felt hungry.
Cold Chuan led me to the kitchen, and about half a person high cake appeared before my eyes, looking delicious.
"Can you eat it?" Cold Chuan asked me.
"May I?"
"Don't worry, this is just for display purposes.".
Cold Chuan said so and carefully dug out a spoon from under the cake: "You see, if you eat it like this, no one will notice." 
"You're really smart, Cold Chuan, to think of such a creative way to eat it!"
It didn't take long for dinner to start, I put on my best dress and discovered that the banquet hall was already filled with people.
Although I knew what kind of scene I should expect but was surprised by how grand it was, I almost dropped my jaw!
Crystal chandeliers, elegant ladies dressed up, stars with distinct personalities, even a red-starred idol...
I should have thought of this earlier, there would definitely be Lin Yu-xiang here.
She ran over to the boss again like glue on his back.
I was about to approach when I saw Wang Xian-chi walk towards Zhao Yi-bao from the other side."
I discreetly approached them and hid behind a window blind, listening carefully as they conversed.
"Ugh, Yi-bao, it's been a long time." Lin Yu-xiang enthusiastically greeted him.
The boss politely nodded his head."
She raised her hand to greet him again, but he didn't move or respond, backing away instead. 
"I'm such a huge fan of you!" Wang Xian-chi exclaimed, "I'm your number one fan!"
Then she turned to Zhao Yi-bao and said, "Yi-bao, I never thought we were so close after all. Why didn't you introduce me to anyone?".
One listen to her words, and Lin Yu-xiang immediately realized Wang Xian-chi was not actually her biggest fan, and her face darkened in anger.
The rival saw each other and became even more jealous."
I noticed the expression of both of them clearly, my heart whispered, "Tear it apart, tear it apart!"
Before they started arguing, someone else walked up to Zhao Yi-bao with a high cup and started chatting with him, talking about business-related matters.
Seeing this, Lin Yu-xiang and Wang Xian-chi calmly left. 
The boss was finally able to relax, I noticed he wanted to move in this direction.I hastily turned around and wrapped myself up in the curtains, hiding securely.
Shouldn't he have noticed me?
"Is the curtain play interesting?" the CEO's mocking voice came from behind.
Ah, I'm still being found out!
Was he looking at me when I "watched" him earlier?
I slowly pulled back my head and peeked out of the curtains to see him wearing a suit that looked very dignified, holding a red wine glass leaning against the wall with a smile on his face.
He picked up his hand and pulled me out from behind the curtain.
His elbow hooked around my neck, gazing at me lazily: "Why were you hiding from me? Hmm?"
"I-I was just admiring your good looks today and didn't want to disturb you,"
It can't be that I've been watching Lin Lu-Xi and Wang Xian-Zhi fight in secret all this time?
"Are you really?"
"Absolutely, more so than diamonds!"
He pulled out his phone and opened WeChat, smiling: "Even if the King of Heaven came today, I wouldn't add sugar to my coffee."
I hesitated for a moment, oh no... 
The CEO just laughed quietly without saying another word.
"You shouldn't laugh, CEO," I said: "I'll make sure to delete it next time."
"No, I'm not serious, I'm really happy you care about me,"
As we were talking, I caught a glimpse of someone bringing out that huge cake.
My heart skipped a beat for a moment but then saw the cake sitting there unattended, so I calmed down.
Watching us be so close to each other made people passing by glance over.
I took hold of the CEO's hand hooked around my neck: "You go talk business now, I'm keeping an eye on you. There are several people wanting to talk to you."
"You don't have to leave," he said: "It's a good opportunity with me here, so others won't dare come over."
I didn't say anything.
Are you just a tool for them?
Suddenly, the CEO Cold walked into the main hall: "Apologies for interrupting your fun simultaneously as well as thank you all for taking time out of your busy schedules to attend this banquet. Here I want to announce something: from now on, our company will be taken over by my son, scholar Cold."
The hall erupted in thunderous applause.
Cold's son, Cold Chuan, stood down there holding a strawberry cake with an expression that looked confused.
CEO Cold cleared his throat and walked down to Cold Chuan's side: "Go ahead and say something."
"Uh... Dad, I'm not ready yet,"
"Shut up!" CEO Cold kicked the table where the cold cream pie was sitting. "I saw everyone supporting you! You're wasting my time with too many words! Get going!"Cold General：「……”
This announcement, and he was suddenly starting to move that big cake.
My heart stopped beating immediately.....
“Ah, oh, I think there's a mouse, the whole cake has been eaten away!” someone exclaimed.
Followed by Cold General's frantic voice screaming at me: “Cold Xiong you little rabbit kid, stand up for old man!”
Then he went looking all over, finally found an old man with a broom and dustpan, chasing after him as fast as his legs could carry him.
The guests saw this and burst out laughing, holding their bellies in pain.
I trembled, ducking my head, unawarely grabbing onto Li Bao's jacket to hide behind him.
“Nothing’s wrong,”
My head shook like a broom, “No, no, nothing’s...”
When I looked around, there were more and more guests coming in, and I saw Wei Zheng sitting across from me.
Ahahah, I have to go find my little brother!
“Boss, as your trusted assistant, I must scold you two times, how can a CEO like you be so lazy at work?” I pretended to be serious, “I have to leave, I won't disturb you and they anymore.”
I finished speaking and took a step forward, but before I could leave, Zhao Linbao grabbed my neck, pulling me back.
“Don’t think I don’t know, you're going to find your idol,”
Is this obvious?!?
Although I was being held by Li Bao, my heart had already flown away to Wei Zheng's side long ago.
I looked over at Zhao Xuan and saw him staring intensely at me, but then he spotted Romo being too clingy to Xiao Yi and pulled me back around.
“Don’t think I don’t know you’re not being honest,”
I couldn't believe it anymore!
Although Li Bao was holding me captive, my heart had already escaped to Wei Zheng's side long ago.
I turned to look at Zhao Xuan, who was staring at Romo and Xiao Yi, a mixture of surprise and disbelief on his face. Zhao Lin Hao confidently grabbed my shoulder: "She's my wife."
"Hey, so...".
"Then I'm not your fan, she's my wife," Zhao Lin Hao interrupted his confusion.
Wu Cheng Rui finally regained a slight calmness to his expression and said with tears in his eyes: "I don't know how I deserve her love like this..."
"Don't think too much about it, maybe you're just lucky." Bao Tang started to feel jealous and scolded him more.
Wu Cheng Rui remained silent...
"I didn't expect to get watermelon soup again...".
I couldn't believe it, even at my age of 20+, I still got chicken pox.
How embarrassing! It was so itchy!
Zhao Lin Hao quickly grabbed my hand: "Don't worry about breaking the mirror."
"It's so uncomfortable..."
"Wait a little longer." He whispered softly, "Be good, listen to me."
Actually, I didn't dare look in the mirror, and I couldn't imagine Bao Tang sleeping next to me for these few days...
I raised my hand to cover my face: "Brother, let's separate rooms."
He pulled my hand down: "Hands are contaminated with bacteria, it's best not to touch each other."
"I don't want to make you sick anyway..."
"Where? I'm fine."
"Just sleep." He nodded and put his hand back on mine.
Even if he was asleep, he would reflexively grab my hand. It wasn't until slowly that I stopped feeling uncomfortable...
I fell asleep without realizing it... till I woke up at three in the afternoon, thinking I must have slept for a long time.
When I stretched, I saw a note on the bedside table: "Don't scratch your face, I'll reduce your food if I see you do it again."
Shrunk? Shrunk?
I sat down next to him and stamped my feet wildly...
Why did we have to eat clear soup so little water for three days? All I could dream of was eating spicy and oily dishes... If I had to cut back on food, I would probably go crazy!
When I came into the kitchen, Li Ma was still making wintermelon soup.
I didn't want it at all...
But then I used my "dramatic gesture" technique and waved my arm around while clutching Li Ma's sleeve: "I'm starving! I want to eat spicy dragon shrimp!"
He refused me, even told me to calm down with mouthwash... It seems like no one can talk to me today.
Bao Tang leaned against the wall, looking uninterested.I was furious and lay down on bed, Zhao Bao Shuai you are a stubborn big fool.
No way, no venting my anger I'm sorry for myself.
I opened wechat, sent him a string of angry messages but when he looked at the message his face turned red with anger it's like a reflex it scared me so much and deleted everything I rewrote softly implying: Boss you're eating what for lunch today?
He replied seconds later: Sugar-glazed pork ribs
I asked if it was spicy
Boss said yes
I said you must be spicy, I can only drink winter melon soup. Don't your conscience hurt at all?!
Boss…….
I'm not going to care anymore I'll just take care of myself and eat well.
I opened the food delivery app ordered a huge portion of spicy little dragon shrimp with a remark: secretly coming quietly please bow down when necessary.
I was proud of my cleverness for ordering like that if the delivery guy follows my instructions he won't be caught.
Just then, Li mom called me to eat.
To avoid being discovered I drank two bowls of winter melon soup and one bowl of congee.
"Mother, you're eating so little is everything okay?"
"Not at all, maybe I ate too much last night now I'm not hungry at all."
I passed off the conversation with Li mom quickly and ran up to get my phone.
The delivery guy was really fast he said it would be there in 15 minutes.
Because of some special circumstances I couldn't show my face so I took out a hat with a chain from the closet.
In front of the mirror I checked myself, yeah not bad the chain pulled tight my whole face was covered up leaving only space for my eyes.
The phone rang again it was the delivery guy saying that the food has arrived please go get it.
I hung up the phone before telling him again be careful don't be found out by anyone.
He told me not to worry he had hidden the small scooter behind a bush and followed my instructions perfectly now he was hiding behind the big gate.
While taking the food I was very cautious so lucky I didn't get caught.
I crept up quietly looking around cautiously but didn't see the delivery guy anywhere.
"Broccoli, broccoli."
Who?
I looked around again and found out that the delivery guy had taken off his uniform and was just sitting against the wall with a tree branch on top of him blending in with the surrounding greenery.
I checked my surroundings carefully to make sure no one had moved.
"Mrs. Qin?"
"Yes I'm here."
Here is the content without any line breaksHe saw me wrapped up like this and was surprised, then said, "Code word."
I froze for a moment, "Code word?"
"Oh no, not again, I'm sorry, I blurted it out," he said, "it's my phone number... 8923."
"Yes, good, just give..." he observed the terrain, "How are you going to get it in anyway?"
I looked around and suddenly realized how stupid I was, "Why don't we go through the back gate instead?" There aren't any packages that can fit through the iron grid yet.
He heard this and his face turned pale, he was shaking his lips and stammering, "Do you have to send me to the back gate? Don't you know how much effort it took me to find the front door? If I had to ride my motorcycle there, it would take at least half an hour, and if I'm late, I'll be charged!"
He became more and more agitated, tears started to well up in his eyes, "You're really pushing me too hard! Why do you have to make me go through the back gate? My house is so big, even if I ride a motorcycle there, it would take at least half an hour! And now that I've already found the front door, I don't want to go through the back gate anymore!"
He became more and more emotional, "I'm just too young and foolish, I don't understand people's hearts and minds! Your house is so rich, doesn't your food taste any better? Why do you have to order food from outside in the first place?"
I didn't expect him to break down crying, I was in a daze, trying to comfort him, "Sorry, it's not my fault, I... I'll give you five-star reviews and give you tips, okay?"
He wiped his tears with his hand, sobbing, "Are you really sorry?"
"Yes,"
"I promise that when you evaluate the delivery boy next time, he's very handsome, can't you?"
"(can)"If previously translated content is also given, use it as reference.

He suddenly laughed: "I don't know whether to praise you for your intelligence or say that you're foolish."
"What do you mean??"
"Intelligent, because you actually thought of a way to get delivery food into the house, stupid, though...,
He lowered his head, pulled open his hat and tie, and revealed my entire face. "Did you think the bank wouldn't send me a bill?"
I coughed: "When I was too excited ordering takeout, I forgot about this."
I stuttered: "You're so rich, why are you wasting your time looking at that small amount of money?"
He held out his hand: 
I weakly placed my hand on top of his hand and pretended to be foolish. "If you want to hold hands, just say so."
"Get me the shrimp in your pocket.")
I jumped back three meters: "No way."
I said it all out and turned around to run, but he quickly grabbed my neck again: "Are you running?"
Oh no, I seem to be trapped by fate's throat.

Idiomatic expression says "fish die before jumping twice" - why not me?
But then I strained myself to say: "Don't, CEO, let's talk about this."
He didn't want to listen to me ramble on and simply pulled my hat tighter, like pulling a bag: "Let's just go inside."
Facing the darkness, I let out a heavy sigh and relaxed my limbs and head, giving up resistance.
"Where did you come back from?" is Lee mom's voice, "Who is this masked bandit?"
"You think someone would infiltrate here?" The CEO spoke with an air of helplessness.
Lee mom suddenly realized: "It can't be the wife."
CEO Zhao finally released me and realized he'd lost his prized shrimp - one that belonged to me. I slumped down, feeling my heart sink into despair).
I didn't get up at all and simply sat on the ground with a limp attitude, holding onto the shrimp tightly.
He pulled down the tie and looked at me straight-faced: "It looks like I've been stuck inside working."
I scowled: "Working from home is inefficient."
Oh well, my hard-earned shrimp was gone.
Although I hadn't eaten the shrimp, I still couldn't forget to give the delivery guy a 5-star review and a tip.

Being forced to eat bland food for weeks made me feel like I could stand under the sun and do photosynthesis.
When my water spots finally cleared up, I excitedly walked over to the table but was surprised to see it was still winter melon soup and rice porridge!
I scowled: "Lee mom, how can you eat this when I'm fine now?"
"Mrs. wife, please keep eating a few more meals so that if my water spots are not fully gone, what will happen?"
Although Lee mom made sense, I was really craving spicy shrimp.
So I turned around and pinched Zhao's sleeve pitifully: "CEO...
He sighed: "Alright, let's go out to eat.""Oh my goodness!" I bounced up and down with excitement.
The whole pot of little dragon shrimp was all mine, and here I had to give a shout-out to it, how fast the boss cracked open the shells!
I was completely satisfied eating to my fill, walked out of the restaurant, and was attracted by the turtle shop across the street.
It's said that a thousand-year-old tortoise lives for ten thousand years, but does a real turtle live up to that long?
I crouched in front of a transparent water tank watching the little turtle swim around and making bubbles.
"Miss, do you like turtles? I'll buy one for you," the shop owner enthusiastically greeted me.
I wanted to buy one, but money wasn't my thing, so I just said, "I'll take a look first."
Zhao Huanbao was also crouched down next to me, "Do you like this one?
"I like it, look at how cute it is, the little turtle walks around with its shell on, making bubbles everywhere,"
It's really too adorable, my heart almost melted.
Perhaps the little turtle understood what I said, constantly crawling towards me and waving its head back and forth.
When it was startled, its head would retreat into its shell, just a few minutes later it would pop out again.
This happened several times, I really laughed at it.
"Miss, have you made up your mind yet?" the shop owner asked.
"Just take this one,"
We were holding onto the transparent water tank with our turtle inside, when Zhao Huanbao got a call from XX Hospital asking him to donate some sperm.
He froze in place with a smile on his face.
I looked at him with a mischievous expression, my face looking like a stereotypical cartoon smile: "Encouragement for this volunteer."
When we arrived at the hospital, there were several nurse sisters gathered around the sperm donation desk.
I was holding onto the turtle while walking around the hospital, attracting their attention quickly, but just as soon as they looked at me again, they turned to look at Zhao Huanbao.
One of them was the same nurse sister I had registered with before, her expression changed from surprise to shock, "Zhao, is that you? We thought it was just this girl registering."
"Ah, if she hadn't registered then that would've been better," Zhao Huanbao shrugged off his frustration.
It seemed like Zhao Huanbao's mood wasn't great either, so I decided to make a quick exit."
Just as I was trying to sneak away when he suddenly had incredible eyesight, caught hold of my back with his fingers, "My dear wife, where are you going?"
"I'm just strolling around, let the turtle absorb the energy from heaven and earth,"
He laughed, "You should wear green clothes too."
"Hey, I'm not a plant!"
He grabbed me and pulled me back, "Come on, maybe there's still something you can help with later."
"I? I don't know if I can do anything to help," I shook my head wildly like a dog shaking water, "That kind of thing is up to you, I'm not good at it anyway."I'm going to translate this content for you.
```
"Don't worry, I'll teach you, and you'll get it soon." 
"No way, I don't want to learn again. Besides, my previous work was not comparable to your twenty years of experience in making perfect porcelain handicrafts."
Zhao Lin Hao: "..."
The nurse sister next to him was quietly discussing the quality of a ruthless CEO.
He heard that and blushed, losing his playful mood, instead taking a cup and walking into the sperm donation room.
I'm not used to the nurse sisters' subtle teasing glances, so I had to hold onto my turtle shell and just walk around aimlessly.
Suddenly, someone yelled out "Yo Yo Yo!"
I looked up and saw that it was Dr. Wu, who was calling me with his usual "Rain Rain" tone, which he hadn't used in a long time...
He seemed too excited to see me, shouting out the name.
I rushed over, excitedly greeting him.
"You new bought that little green turtle? It's so cute." He gently tapped its head with his finger, then asked, "But who was that guy earlier?"
I nodded.
He sighed and looked up at the sky, tilting his head 45 degrees upwards, looking wistful. "We're both wanderers in this vast world, we're both crazy people..."
"I don't understand," I was taken aback by what he said.
"He's already remarried, you can't hold onto him anymore." Dr. Wu pleaded with me. "If you think about it, love is not all it's cracked up to be."
I finally realized that he thought my new wife was actually me.
"I'm sorry, I didn't understand,"
But before I could say anything, Dr. Wu suddenly grabbed me tightly: "Leave him, we'll stick together from now on."
"This is the charming and calm psychological doctor who has embarrassed my wife again!"
The ruthless CEO's voice was delayed but never absent.
I turned around and replied: "He didn't seem to understand."
Dr. Lin Hao looked at me again and asked, "Are you my wife or ex-wife?"
I explained everything in detail to Dr. Wu, who nodded seriously: "It's like changing your head."
We were walking when Dr. Lin Hao suddenly patted Dr. Wu on the shoulder and said: "Would you like me to set you up with someone?"
"No need." Dr. Wu shook his head. "I'll just suffer in my own loneliness."
```Baozi made an okay gesture, pretending to be surprised and said, "Sorry, I forgot to wash my hands after donating a small snail earlier."
Wu doctor's face turned green instantly, his hands moved wildly as he quickly took off his white coat and tossed it onto the floor, saying, "I'm next!"
I was sweating bullets, Baozi ate his own emotions and could think of anything that would make him angry.
"Rain Qi."
His tone was serious, and I became tense too, rushing to respond, "Uh?"
"Don't let anyone just hug you again, okay?"
"It's no big deal, he's Wu doctor, not a bad person."
"I don't care about anyone, but..."
He stared straight at me, saying, "I really like you, and maybe you can't imagine it. I love you so much that even if I held you in my hands, I wouldn't know what to do."
I was touched, took a deep breath, "Baozi, I won't leave your side unless one day you kick me out."
After getting a pet, I've been holding on for dear life.
Suddenly, the turtle shell was gone, and no matter how hard he tried with his fingernails, he couldn't make any sound come out. I panicked, worried that the turtle might be dead.
Zhao Lin Hao laughed and said, "Dude, it's winter sleep! You didn't even notice the water froze, did you?"
Not only did I like this little turtle, but even Xiaocheng also loved it, and even gave it a name - Uncle. 
I burst into laughter, asked him, "Why did you call it Uncle?"
"Because Uncle is just like the turtle, always spitting out bubbles."
"I don't understand?" I was full of questions, "What's this 'spitting out bubbles' thing?"
"Ah, yes! Uncle often scolds me, and his words are particularly hurtful. Mom said that if Uncle continues to be mean, we should just call him 'spitting out bubbles'!"
So the turtle's name was finally decided.
When Zhao Lin Hao came home from work and saw us both kneeling in front of the glass tank laughing at the turtle, I was happy before, but when he heard me say, "Ha ha ha, Uncle is so stupid, he hit his head on the stone!", my face turned dark red.
After October, the weather suddenly turned chilly, the leaves turned yellow, and the wind blew them down to the ground, gently twirling around. 
Finally, before Double Eleven, I finished knitting a sweater for Zhao Lin Hao.
I couldn't wait to go to the office and give it to him, when I arrived at the reception area, I saw a group of people laughing and having fun around the front desk.
I approached them, "What's going on?"
The staff quickly covered their smiles, some even turned red in the face.
I was confused, and finally the receptionist said, "Someone sent you a flag to Zhao Lin Hao."
A flag? What's so funny about that?
I unfolded the flag and looked at it, waiting for it to reveal what it said. When I saw the words, I couldn't help but laugh out loud.
The flag read:
Given to: Zhao Lin Hao Mr. 
Then there were several large golden letters in the middle: Perfectly perfect.These few words at first glance seemed meaningless, but in the bottom left corner it was clearly written: xx Hospital Donation Center.
I couldn't help but burst out laughing! Lord has mercy, Lord has mercy, now everyone knows what you went through!
When I laughed uncontrollably, no one could continue to hold back their smiles. The entire hall erupted in a wave of laughter.
I wiped away tears from the corners of my eyes and proudly displayed the flag: "Everyone, take a look while you can, or when the Lord arrives, there won't be any more chances!"
"I've already arrived."
The sound of my voice stopped the laughter abruptly. I stiffened and turned my head to see Zhao Ling's gloomy face.
"Lord... Lord, look at the flag."
"I don't want to look." He refused very firmly.
I tried to maintain a calm exterior and said, "It doesn't matter whether you look or not."
He raised an eyebrow: "Throw it away!"
Throw it away? How could I?!
He reached out to take the flag, and I turned around to dodge. "Qin Yuwei!" He shouted loudly, then sighed, his tone softening: "Listen."
"I won't!" I said and turned my head to run, but only felt a tight band around my waist before my feet lifted off the ground.
I was spinning around in mid-air when I realized it was the Lord holding me up with one hand, pinning me to his shoulder.
No matter how hard I struggled, he didn't let go.
"You can't move anymore!"
He said with an air of warning. I slumped my head, deciding to give up struggling.
With that, he walked into the CEO's office, carrying a file bag in one hand and pinning me to his shoulder with the other.
I finally landed on solid ground.
I jumped twice.
The Lord still remembered the flag: "Give it back."
It seemed like these two were not going to forget this for a while. I decided to change the subject: "So, you're curious about why I came to the company?"
I pulled out a warm sweater from my backpack: "Take a look!"
His expression immediately turned from serious to cheerful: "Thank you, Lord Wei!"
"Nothing, nothing!" I said with a smile.
Not a moment later, Wang Xine took over with a tray of coffee, looking slightly nervous: "Oh dear, sorry that I didn't prepare your coffee... "
I waved my hand dismissively: "It's fine, I don't drink coffee.""Wow, Mrs. CEO, is this sweater you made yourself?"
She was staring at my hands holding a sweater, "How admirable of you! No matter what shape it takes, there's someone willing to wear it. Not like me, even if I do something better, what use is that to me?"
Me: "..."
The green tea smell had almost blown away the Joyo Mountains.
"Assistant Wang, since you're so skilled at making sweaters, should I contact a textile factory for you?" Zhao Ling suddenly said casually.
Wang Xi'er's expression froze for a moment before she embarrassedly waved her hand dismissively: "Don't bother."
A tea connoisseur who was scolding! But I felt that the CEO was bossing around the female lead...
I couldn't help but raise my big finger in the heart: absolute heaven!
Then this laborer CEO looked at Wang Xi'er without even noticing him, and sat down to look at the reports. I too had nothing better to do, so I started flirting with a girl who liked to browse shopping.
She saw me come and was startled into thinking of hiding her phone, but I rushed to stop her: "Don't worry, I won't tell the CEO."
I said that just as I poured myself a stool and sat next to her: "Are you done making up the order?"
"Only ten yuan left, how can it be finished?" She was a bit disappointed.
"I'll help you research." I peeked over my shoulder with fingers crossed, "Discount plus cross-store discount is exactly what we need."
She shook her head in dismay: "I don't understand, taking away the coupon and there's still ten yuan left to reach five thousand."
"You misunderstood it, the cross-store discount is based on the original price."
Her eyes lit up: "You really mean that?"
I nodded: "Yes, but I'm fast-paced and worrisome, afraid of getting snatched by others."
"Actually, grabbing stuff requires skill." She demonstrated as she spoke: "Watch this before the opening, always come and go back to swipe continuously."
So I learned a few moves, at first awkwardly stumbling through it, but eventually became smoother, even able to swipe while closing my eyes.
"Did you learn?"
I nodded: "Learned."
Only that sound…
I jolted with surprise: "CEO... CEO!"
The girl who was discussing enthusiastically with me just a moment ago had suddenly disappeared into her files and was intensely reading them as if we had never talked before.
Zhao Ling didn't seem angry at all: "Did you get anything for me?"If previously translated content is also given, use it as reference.

I whispered softly: "Blowing wind, where did you see that? I haven't spent too much money, and I didn't even show you how I saved up gold coins to be thrifty with your money?"
Zhao Lin Hao:「……"
Thankfully, he was wealthy and generous, and didn't argue with me.
That night, I excitedly had him try on the sweater I made for him. However, I miscalculated the head hole size, so the sweater's neck was too small, and my head couldn't fit inside.
He saw me looking like a frostbitten eggplant, sitting by his side and gently hugging my waist to comfort me: "Rain Vi, I'm already very happy with it. If not, maybe I'll squeeze it again to see if it can fit you."
Anyway, we were going to re-make it, so I might as well use a bit of force to pull it down.
The neckband kept getting tangled and twisted on his head boss face, finally jammed into the forehead area. I strained with all my might, but he had a protruding nose that wouldn't let the sweater go under.
I was about to give up, but he grabbed the sweater's hem and pulled it hard, miraculously managing to get it over his head.
"I almost ruined my face from trying to squeeze into this shirt," he laughed.
The sweater initially looked great, but only because the neckband was too tight. 
"Maybe I should re-make it again..."
"Not necessary, I'm satisfied. And by the way, you worked extra hard on this the other day, and I watched with worry."
He tried to calm me down, but only made me feel worse, as he kept telling me how great my previous work was.
Perhaps he wanted to distract me, strongly advising: "You're already very skilled at it, look at this pattern - can you tell it's a soap bubble shape or not?"
"Ahahahaha, that's the sea turtle!"
「……"
My eyes started to water: "Boss..."
He raised his hand to wipe away my tears.
"I was thinking about how I'll take it off later,"
Zhao Lin Hao:「……I never thought of this."
"My eyes are brimming with tears:"
"Small cry bag." He gently patted me on the back.
"I was thinking about what time it would be when you took it off,"
Zhao Lin Hao:「……I hadn't thought of that either."
I wiped away my tears: "If I couldn't take it off, I'd just cut it open."
"You didn't think of that?" he laughed, "Why don't we try it right now and see?"
I still hadn't reacted when he wrapped his arms around me, and suddenly brought me to bed. He then leaned in close and kissed me. 
"I'll come back and take it off later," I giggled.
He smiled: "Are you sure?"
His lips almost touched my cheek, but I suddenly thought of something important, pushed him away with my hand, and hurriedly asked: "What time is it now?"
Zhao Lin Hao: “… Eleven thirty-five. What's wrong?"
I hastily sat up, grabbed my phone, and opened the Taobao app: "Thank goodness, thank goodness, I almost forgot to buy things!"
Zhao Lin Hao:「……"
"I bought you a pair of trendy pants with an office style, they're really cool!"
"I'm afraid..."If previously translated content is also given, use it as reference.

给王总煮长寿面
 Viewing details: Serving King with longevity noodles
十二、给王总煮长寿面
不得不说，双十一的物流越来越给力，下单第三天就到了。
I have to say, the logistics of Double Eleven are getting better and better. The order arrived just one day after I placed it.
我拿到快递迫不及待撕开，待看到裤子时不禁为自己的欣赏水平沾沾自喜。
When I got the package, I couldn't wait to open it. As soon as I saw the pants, I couldn't help but feel proud of my own taste.
霸总穿上这潮裤，一定是个精神小伙！
The king must be a cool guy when wearing these trendy pants!
我正想扔袋子，忽然发现里面有一抹红，我把它拿出来一看，发现居然是条全新的红内裤。
I was about to throw the bag away, but suddenly I saw a red one inside. It's actually a brand new red underwear.
怎么回事？难道卖家装错货了？
What is going on? Was it sold by mistake?
我点开淘宝。
I checked Taobao.
我：亲，在吗？你给我多发了条红内裤。
"Hello, is there anyone here? Can you please send me more red underwear?"
客服：是的呢亲，因为这边后台看到今年是您的本命年，而且还是新客，所以我们老板非常慷慨地送您一条。
"Yes, of course, because we saw that it's your lucky year this year and you're a new customer, our boss is very generous to send you one."
我：原来是这样啊？那替我谢谢你们老板啦。
"I knew it. Thank you so much for the boss!"
客服：不客气呢，亲。
"You're welcome, of course."
虽然只是条红内裤，但我还是感觉受到了关怀，心里暖暖的。
Although it's just a piece of underwear, I still feel like I've been treated well and my heart is warm.
好评！好评！五星好评！
I'm giving 5 stars!
我扔掉袋子，拿着潮裤不停端详，突然发现路人都用奇怪的眼神看着我。
I threw the bag away, holding the pants and staring at them intently. Suddenly, people on the street were staring at me with strange looks.
我懵逼半秒便反应过来，我在大街上甩着条红内裤！
I was shocked for a half second before I realized what was happening, and I was wearing a red underwear in the middle of the street!
我慌忙间随手把它塞进潮裤兜里了。
I quickly stuffed the underwear into my pants pocket.
……」
回到家时，赵霆皓还没下班。
When I came back home, Zhao Glen hadn't finished work yet.
我坐在房间把裤子摊在床上打算拍张照片给他，忽然门口传来喇叭声，没一会儿便是他的声音：「雨薇呢？」
I sat in the room to take a photo of the pants, and suddenly I heard a ringing sound at the door. It was his voice: "Where's Rain?"
嘻嘻，我在这儿呢！
"Ha ha, I'm here!"
我抱起裤子就往楼梯口跑，正好看见霸总从门口进来。
I picked up the pants and ran towards the staircase just as the king walked in.
「霸总，你的裤子到啦！」
"King, your pants are finally here!"
我穿着棉拖鞋刷啦刷啦跑过去，又噔噔噔往楼下跑。
I was wearing slippers and ran towards him again, then ran downstairs with him.
「你慢点儿，别摔了。」 
"Slow down, don't fall!"I saw my body falling down, and Zhao Liao looked at me with a frightened expression.
My mother screamed loudly, "Mrs. be careful!"
Only for two seconds, I fainted, and what I saw was a staircase.
"Ah!"
My body leaned forward, thinking I would hit the ground, but Zhao Liao precisely caught me.
Crash!
I fell down beside him, he crouched down on the ground holding onto me tightly.
I didn't get hurt at all, but in my ear, I heard Zhao Liao's soft groans.
"Zhao Liao! Zhao Liao!" I immediately got up, my heart sank to the bottom of a pit, "How are you? Did you get hurt?"
He furrowed his brow, like he was suppressing pain.
I cried frantically, "Boss, you're okay? What's wrong with you?"
My hands were shaking uncontrollably, I pressed the phone for a few times before finally getting through to my private doctor.
Soon, the doctor arrived, after a check-up, Zhao Liao turned out to be lucky, only having a slight waist twist and a minor fracture on his right wrist."
After setting a plaster, I was afraid so much that I held onto his waist tightly, burying my face in his chest crying.
He gently patted my back with his left hand soothingly, saying he wasn't hurt at all, telling me not to cry.
I wiped away tears, bowing my head, feeling regretful, 
If only I hadn't saved him, he wouldn't have gotten hurt.
He seemed to know exactly what was in my heart and changed the subject, "This is the pair of pants you bought for me!"
"Yeah." I sniffled and nodded, showing it to him, "Do you like them?"
"Good... they're good..." He paused for a moment, "Only why did you buy so many?"
"I don't know." I shrugged.
「……")
The next day, Zhao Liao woke up early and even woke me up to go to work. The reason was that his hand was hurt and couldn't drive, so we took the bus together.
"You're not supposed to have a special driver, right?"
He smiled, "I don't use drivers much, let's just get going."
I didn't expect it at all, but one day, I saw the whole city trembling because of that strong man, and even a Y City boss would dare to sit on public transport.
Although I was curious about why he didn't drive, I decided not to ask anymore.
I thought he would wear a suit and tie, but this time again, Zhao Liao wore a casual shirt and those trendy pants!
Dressed so casually for work?
I just wondered for a second before realizing that he probably liked those trendy pants too.
HereHmm, it's him all right.
Because his hand was injured, I had to help him with everything, even feeding him. He kept saying that he could do it himself.
“Actually, your left hand can hold a spoon…”
“No, you're just not used to it yet.”
「……”
Good grief, we finally managed to take care of him and now we're at the bus station, and before long the bus arrives, his boss tells me to get money, but I accidentally pull out his red underwear when I'm handing it over.
“What is this?”, Zhao Linbo says with a stern tone.
“It's... my new red underwear.” I mumble, not daring to look up at him.
The passengers' eyes are all on the red underwear in my hand now.
“If you're mad, don't be,” I say trying to lighten the mood. “This one is brand new and still has the tag on it.”
「……”
When he looks at me with a look of disdain, I rush to explain. “It's not like that, actually. Yesterday when I opened my package, there was this red underwear inside. I asked customer service about it, and they said it was from the boss. I just put it in my pocket without thinking, and then I forgot about it.”
By now, several passengers are trying to stifle their laughter, but you can still see the corners of their mouths twitching with amusement.
“Why is it red?” Zhao Linbo asks sternly, his voice rising.
“It's because... the boss said it was my auspicious year…”, I say, getting quieter and quieter.
「……”
When he looks around at all the passengers who are trying not to laugh, we get off the bus.
Just as we're about to leave, a passenger shouts out, “Don't go! Please stay for another ride!”
Me: “…”
CEO Zhao Linbo: “We'll stop at the next station…”
At the next station, just as we're about to get off, someone yells out, “Wait, is that the CEO and his wife?! What are you guys doing here?!”
I feel embarrassed but if Zhao Linbo looks even more embarrassed than I do, he must be in charge at the company anyway.
Instantly, I stand up for him. “You're mistaken! He's not our CEO. And you can see that he's not wearing a suit today.”
“Are you sure you can handle it, Mrs.? He is much taller and stronger than you…”
I turn my head to look at Zhao Linbo, but to my surprise, he hasn't turned his back on us.
He clears his throat awkwardly and turns serious. “Actually, I have a task for you all. You need to submit your plan by tomorrow.”Here is the translation:
「Who is this person？I didn't expect it to be our CEO. Oh well, he looks a bit like me too……」A lower-ranking officer trembled with fear and couldn't even look at Zhao Lei皓, „I'm sorry, I'm not good at acknowledging my mistakes.“
「……”
「Get off the bus。」Our CEO ordered me, and I nodded enthusiastically, following him away from this chaotic situation.
We looked at the empty bus, feeling carefree for a moment, but we didn't know where to go afterwards.
I weakly asked him if he was going back to work. He said it was time for him to take a break.

We stared at each other, remained silent for a second, and then burst into laughter simultaneously 「Hahaha!」
「Are you trying to make amends with your employees by threatening them?» I looked up at him, grabbing his arm.
„No.“
„Really?“
„Really.“
„I don't believe it!“
——
He opened WeChat, and there was a message from the same lower-ranking officer who had sent us that earlier：Oh my god, good riddance!  I was lucky to be driving when I was supposed to drive that car today, so I had a whole day off. And then I met the Toxic King on the bus. I'm drunk just thinking about it, he almost killed me! What a near-death experience! [Crying] 
The message got deleted after a while.
After that, our social media feeds were flooded with：RIP to his car which will never need maintenance again[Teary eyes][Teary eyes][Teary eyes][Teary eyes][Teary eyes]
Zhao Lei皓 raised an eyebrow „Toxic King?“
„Don't even think about it. I'm confident in what I said.“I continued, „You should really change your way of speaking. While you do have a strong presence, it's not good for the employees who fear you all the time.“)
He shrugged, „I accept their criticism so I'll make sure to highlight my personality even more so I won't be called Toxic King anymore.“
「……”
We returned to our original route and just as we got back home, we saw Cold Chen sitting on the sofa, staring at an aquarium with a turtle. 
「What are you doing here?」Zhao Lei皓 looked like he didn't want him there.
„I came to see the little turtle.“Cold Chen ignored Zhao Lei皓's greeting and asked me, „Rainy, why isn't that turtle moving?“
„It's hibernating.“
„Okay, I'll give it a name. How about 'Cold Rain' since our names go well together anyway.“ 
„Don't bother, little program has already been given one. Let's call him uncle.“ 
「……Hahahaha!」
Zhao Lei皓's face darkened 「I won't laugh again, I'll take you out of here right away!“
Cold Chen remained calm and continued talking to me „I was going to name it Cold Rain because it matches our names. It has a nice atmosphere to it.“ 
Zhao Lei皓 clamped his teeth shut „Get out.“
Cold Chen was used to the CEO's mannerisms, so he wasn't bothered by it at all. He even responded as if they were having a casual conversation „Zhao Lei皓, I've been feeling down lately and want to go to your house to relax in the sauna.“Is your house okay?
"It's dry, I don't have rainbows either," he said, turning his head away and looking at me, "Rainbows, let's go with you."
So, Han Chuan, me, and Zhao Lin Hao walked into the sauna room together. After a while, both of them started arguing over their seats because they wanted to sit next to me.
The CEO ordered Han Chuan to move away from me.
He refused to shift even an inch, saying he liked sitting there because my side was good for his wind direction.
Seeing that Zhao Lin Hao had brought oil and salt, Zhao Lin Hao could only stand on one leg.
Han Chuan retaliated by kicking him one foot after another. He started pretending to break wrists.
"Hey, your hands are all broken, do you still think you can beat me?"
"I'll even give you one hand, don't think about trying to win."
"...".
Finally, they calmed down. I had thought that things would settle down after that, but soon my phone rang again.
I looked at it and saw that they were fighting on Weibo.
First, Han Chuan posted a message: Reward for anyone who can come up with a way to deal with a numbskull like him.
The comments poured in.
Production Team hit the nail on the head: Let's give him a fart to smell. Let him know what it's like to be stuffed with salted pork!
Next, Zhao Lin Hao posted a message with an emoticon。
I made fun of myself when I was young: Give him a hat to wear.

After that, Zhao Lin Hao didn't want to back down either: Reward for anyone who can deal with me properly. Anyone who dares to call me "Dad" will get five hundred million!
Production Team hit the nail on the head again: Dad.
Zhao Lin Hao replied: You're not the one who told him to grab a fart to smell, are you?
Production Team hit the nail on the head once more: That was a fake, I didn't do it.
Beautiful Girl scolded Han Chuan: @Han Chuan This is five hundred million in business. Are you going to do it or not?
I really want Zhao Lin Hao to end up with someone. It's got to be him and Luo Zheng, or maybe he'll end up with Han Chuan, I have to lock them down.

The two of them's fight quickly rose to the top of the trending topics. Both companies' official Weibo accounts came out to apologize.
"Stop fighting, you're being too much," I said.
Zhao Lin Hao wrapped his arms around me and looked at Han Chuan menacingly: "I told you, raindrop hurts me, I'm scared that you'll be unhappy."
"...I can't, I just want to sit still.
I'm not going to look at the two of them flying around and staring at each other's eyes, so I'll just lean against the wall and close my eyes.
Suddenly, I feel dizzy, maybe it's because I've been steaming for too long? When I open my eyes, the scene in front of me scares me half to death!
My perspective has shifted to third person again, and I'm seeing myself sitting in the middle of Zhao Lin Hao and Cold Yanyan.
I try hard to shake my head, and when I open my eyes again, I see that I'm still in the same position. Zhao Lin Hao is still staring at Cold Yanyan beside him.
Maybe it's because I've been steaming for too long, that I'm experiencing hallucinations.
I decide to leave quickly.
I spent a day with Cold Yanyan, and it turns out he's not really mad at me after all. His personality is just weird.

...…
"Emperor, are you playing QQ?"
"Seven or eight years haven't used it, what's wrong?"
"I want to add you."
I silently laugh to myself. It's been almost ten years since I've used QQ, so this is perfect for me to snoop on him when he's being a middle schooler again.
He didn't notice that I had a crush on him in my heart, and he downloaded QQ without even thinking about it. He entered his username, password, and clicked "Forget Password" .....

It only took a few clicks, and suddenly there was a barrage of messages from seven or eight years ago. The sound went off for half a minute.
His profile picture is an old picture of him holding onto the wind, with the name "I love Zhenhao" written on it.
As for his nickname, I don't feel angry at all. After all, Zhao Lin Hao had set up this whole scenario to make me fall in love with him.
He immediately blocked my screen and tried to hide his panic. "Maybe I'll add you?"
"Okay, you scan me."
"Uh...no need, just say the number." Ha ha, it's rare to see the Emperor looking so nervous.
So I said my QQ number.
But after waiting for a long time, no friend requests appeared, and I looked at his screen to investigate. 
My eyes widened in shock when I saw that he was shaking uncontrollably like a toy that had been hit with an iron rod. 
I forgot that I set up the verification question, and it's "Call me Dad".
I take a deep breath and look at the Emperor's face, which is already starting to turn pale.
I try to help him input the answer, but he brutally pushes me away and makes me shut my eyes.
When I open my eyes again, I see that he kept entering incorrect answers. "Oh no, not...,
He sends a flying eye attack at me.If previously translated content is also given, use it as reference.
我乖乖闭嘴.
 
“实际…答案是……”
眼刀警告.
 
我识相闭嘴.
 
终于，我看见他拧着眉头，略有迟疑地输入“我一声爹”。
 
验证成功！
 
霸总：「……”
 
通过验证后，我给霸总改备注时发现他手速极快地把昵称改成了“我爱雨薇”.
 
嘀嘀嘀嘀.
 
他手机响起 QQ 提示音.
 
都那么久没上线了，还会有哪个“考古”网友会给他发消息呢？
 
我好奇凑过去一瞧，待看清屏幕时差点笑死。
 
你不换人喜欢，我就不改昵称：老兄，我天天上线只为盯着你，快十年了！你他妈终于换一个人喜欢了！我终于可以改网名啦！呜呜呜（_）
 
赵霆皓：真难为你了…
 
我迫不及待去翻他空间，可这人也太无趣了吧！
 
说说加起来不到十个！而且都是“简单的数学课”、“下一节物理，我已经开始困了”、“语文连堂课，无聊”之类的，而且连个配图都没有……
 
霸总你这是在抄课程表呢！
 
无聊。
 
可他一直盯着手机看，我疑惑，莫非是在看曾经网聊的小姐姐空间？
 
我悄悄咪咪走过去，发现他居然在翻我的 QQ 空间，从 2009 年到现在。
 
完了，我的黑历史！
 
怎么忘记了我登录的是自己的真实账号啊？
 
此时想删可已经来不及了，他已经开始笑了。
 
本来想偷窥他的中二记录的，怎么现在好像反了？
 
“笑？有什么好笑的？”我撅嘴。
 
他边笑边把我发的说说读出来：「转发这只喜羊羊，接下来一周都会喜气洋洋.”
 
我尴尬想去抢他的手机，他眼疾手快躲开了，还继续念：「我倒，英语只考了 61 分还有救么？”
 
我：「……”
 
现在拉黑霸总还来得及吗？
 
“毕业了.”他看着我的 QQ 空间 “雨薇你穿学士服真好看.”
 
Please note that this translation is based on the provided Chinese content.Okay, I now don't want to blacklisted him anymore.
He suddenly said：「Can you still use this account and contact people over there?\"
I reacted for a while, then shook my head.
Through my experiment, true social media accounts can appear in novel worlds, while novel world accounts cannot appear in real-world.
Perhaps this is the result of being more substantial than virtual ones.
「Rain Violets, you're here too。」
I was moved to tears and he suddenly stopped, saying：「However, did you pass your English test with 61 points and get a four-year degree?\"
Me：「……Fell into bad luck, passed by 425 though.»
Overlord：「……」
「You always talk about my English grades, you too have an English grade of 8.0 then.\"
He laughed saying：「Not bad at all.»
Interrupted.
Rationally speaking, I really can't understand why Zhao Lin Hua fell for me? He is good-looking and intelligent, and he has many assets. Why else would he like someone like me?
Maybe it's my protagonist's halo that's too strong? If I wasn't the protagonist, would he still like me?.
I walked down the street, thinking about this problem, and my head was about to explode.
Don't understand, we don't understand the Overlord's brain waves.
Just when I was deciding not to think about this anymore, I was suddenly grabbed and thrown into a Bentley.
「Who are you guys? Let me go!」
I struggled hard, but the other party is a trained bodyguard, and I am just an insignificant weakling in front of them.
Ah, now I can only try to rescue myself.
「Don't press on me anymore,」I twisted my body and turned over the person pressing on my shoulder, 「Ow!」
They released their hands after that, and I secretly opened my phone to send a location to Zhao Lin Hua via WeChat.
Originally I wanted to send „Save Me“, but suddenly a big hand covered my screen.
That bodyguard shook his head saying：「No, no can do.`
Another bodyguard then made a call, saying：「Don't worry, Wang总, we have already caught her inside the car.\"
Wang total? The character Chi Kuan who is so ruthless?
Relie, this guy is too evil! He's even more sinister than the Overlord!
「Caught?!」The voice on the other end was furious and shouted loudly, 「I said it a million times, let me invite people over! Invite people! Do you understand? Or are you just waste?!""
I was full of black lines, my face was completely pale.
Here is the translated content:The king looked like Zhao Ling was 20 years older and had become balding already.
「King Uncle, what's the purpose of inviting me?」 I tried to be cute.
He heard it and almost spit out his tea: „Uncle! I'm just 30!"""
「……"
„However, you can call me uncle too, or else my age will surpass that of Zhao Ling. „ He said, starting to choke up, „I'll only get ahead in these areas compared to that guy. „
Looks like this person is being squeezed by the CEO.
「Brother? Brother? I'm your brother? Can you call me that?""
He didn't say anything.
Fine, then I'll just assume he agreed.
„Brother, why did you invite me here?""
„I don't know, I just thought of coming to see you.„
 „What's there to look at?""
„You were in a hurry when you gave me the sheep pot last time and I didn't get to see it clearly.„
„The last time... I was careless and picked up the wrong one. Hah, got it right this time.„
I quietly wiped my sweat, but maybe this person is here to seek revenge?

「No worries, it's all forgotten.„)
„？？？""
„Did you hear that Zhao Ling gave me a birthday gift last time?""
„Ugh, don't mention it. The gift was terrible and made him crack his teeth in anger. „
„Are you kidding me? He told me yesterday that I bought him a birthday present while he has a wife who did it to me.„
「……"
„Can you give me some gifts too? I'm going to be born tomorrow.` He looked gloomy, „I want to boast in front of that Zhao guy again. „
I reluctantly agreed:「…… okay.„
He was overjoyed and ordered his assistant to get me a sweet drink.
„Or I can make you a noodle for you.""
„Just one?""
„Yeah, though it's just one long noodle. So I wish you live 100 years or more.`
He was tearful: „Good, good. „If previously translated content is also given, use it as reference.
Combine multiple empty lines in a row into a single one.
I felt a slight sympathy for the miserable middle-aged man who was lacking love.
Luckily, I had learned hand-pulling noodles from my mother before, and it was really easy to me.
It took some time to wake up, and King Total enthusiastically dragged me along, insisting on bringing me to his backyard pond to play.
But this was just a small pond, wasn't it? This was definitely not a lake at all.
Feeling bored, I decided to teach him about floating stones.
I picked up a small flat stone, bending down slightly and throwing it onto the water's surface with great force. The stone floated for seven or eight times on the water: "How's that? Is it working?"
 "It's fun." He randomly picked up another stone and threw it in with one loud splash.
 "That's not right. It should be a flatter stone." I said, picking out a better one for him, "Here, try this one."
This time he managed to float the stone three times.
 "You two are having so much fun, aren't you?"
I turned around: "Boss?"
Zhang Bao Luo came over and held my hand, leading me away from King Total and telling him, "My wife and I won't bother you. Let's leave for now."
 "Wait a minute." King Total blocked his way, "How can we finish the noodles without it being perfect?"
 Zhang Bao Luo looked back at me, in amazement: "Are you still going to make him noodles?"
I nodded: "It's his birthday tomorrow."
 "My birthday? You never made me any noodles!" King Total said, scolding him, and gave him a dirty look.
King Total dared: "Want to challenge me to see who can float the stone better?"
Although Zhang Bao Luo used his left hand, but poor King Total couldn't even float the stone on the surface of the water, let alone throw it.
 "King Total 13, I'm 22." I said 
 "I don't believe you. Let's do it again!"
Zhang Bao Luo shrugged: "Your turn."
They had been competing for ten rounds already. If they kept going like this, even the lake might get filled!
"Enough competition. Let's make noodles instead,"
 I finished making the noodles, and King Total slurped them down with a huge mouthful, each slurp causing Zhang Bao Luo's face to darken by one point.
I was on edge, fearing that he would get angry and flip over the table 
As we left, King Total stood at the door waving goodbye, allowing me to come back anytime.
 Why not? I'm probably going to die tonight!Recently, a video of Wang Zhongxian, a top executive at a certain company, went viral on social media and was jokingly referred to as " Zhao Xian Hao's Diary for Old Men".
Journalist Miss: Mr. Wang, how do you feel about your arch-rival Zhao Xianhao, who is now the CEO?
Wang Zhongxian (looking up at the sky): Actually, we're not exactly rivals or enemies; we actually have a business relationship. To be honest, I thought he looked like a total novice in his early days as CEO, almost like someone who had been driven crazy by love. But now I understand him, and his wife is really cute. Oh, heaven! Give me a wife like that someday!
The live chat room was filled with comments like "Maybe this is the sound of middle-aged men's whining."
Miss: Mr. Wang, what's your attitude towards Zhao Xianhao? Are you admiring him or not? What specifically do you mean?
Wang Zhongxian: Well, I suppose I admire him a bit, but mostly I just don't understand him. Why do journalists keep rushing to take his picture, even though he's clearly out of touch with reality? Why do people call him "Old Boy" while calling me "Old Man"?
The live chat room: Fool because you're missing that perfect face!
I almost died from laughing.
Just then, my phone rang. It was Qin Zidian.
Qin Zidian: Sister, help! I need to get married!
I: Slow down, drink some water first.
Qin Zidian: You'll come and set me up with someone, okay?
I: Okay….
Qin Zidian: My friend's mom is working at a matchmaking agency, trying to meet the quota. She assigned six potential matches for me today! I don't know how to deal with it!
I: Don't be stupid; if the CEO finds out, I won't be able to back you up.
Qin Zidian: He and Wang Zhongxian have been in a relationship for half a year now. With all that work going on, where's he supposed to find time for me?
I: Who is Qin Zidian? 
Qin Zidian: What are you talking about? Isn't it obvious? Don't pretend like you don't know!
I: Okay... I'll set up five of them, and you can take one.
I spent the whole night writing a script to tell Zhao Xianhao this stuff, but when I woke up, he was already gone.
Hmm, let me hurry back home before the CEO leaves for the day. We have six potential matches - Qin Zidian and I will each take three.
1st match is a novelist who looks good on paper.
I'm pretty much like half an artist too; we should have some common interests. What's better than becoming brothers?
We agreed to meet at the city park, but when I looked around, I didn't see him anywhere.
Did he stand us up?
Someone suddenly took my picture and said, "Excuse me, are you Qin Zidian?"
I turned back, and it was 1st match who just stood there looking completely different from his photos!
…I'm confused: "How do you know me?"
To know that he has a photo of Qin Zhanhua.
"I saw you looking at my photo, just like finding someone over hills and forests, so I guessed."
"...you and your photo, there's a significant difference, right?"
"Not very much, it's really good, isn't it? Your face is okay, just saying about the body, where are your six abdominal muscles gone? Have you concentrated them into one?
"He frankly said: "p" of mine, but you also..."
"I'm p too."
"Actually, even if you're not p, you're still pretty good-looking." His complexion turned pink slightly, and he scratched his head embarrassed.
I felt a sense of alarm in my heart, won't this person like me at all?
Ha ha, I'm glad I have a trump card!
Firstly, implement Plan A.
"Brother, do you want to eat something?"
He was stunned: "Old... old brother?"
"Give me a box of yogurt."
He sat there in a daze, staring blankly into space as he walked into the nearby supermarket with an expression full of questions.
When he came out, I found that he had actually bought Armarro and Purina yogurt.
I sighed: "Brother, actually, you can just buy Yili Dairy or similar brands."
Other people are sincere to me, but I'm lying and deceiving them... a little bit feels guilty.
Let's go with the original plan anyway.
I ripped open the lid, then stuck out my tongue and licked it, doing three circles in each direction, clockwise and counterclockwise, licking until the seal was completely broken, and the yogurt was almost bursting.
Ha ha, if he saw me licking the yogurt seal, he probably wouldn't like me at all."
But this guy is staring at me with a warm expression... 
"You lick the yogurt seal's shape so beautifully...." 
I threw myself away 
Can his charm of licking the yogurt seal not save me?So what can people with real power do that's impressive?
"I lied about my overseas study experience on my relative's information, actually I dropped out of college and can't compare to you, so whatever."
I turned around to leave, but he grabbed me by the arm:"I'm not rejecting you."
Uh-oh, it looks like this guy is really interested in me!
Now that things have taken a turn for the worse, I've only got a C plan left.
I stopped walking and sat down on a park bench, pulling out a bunch of small red flowers from my bag:"These are the ones I used to get when I was in kindergarten. There were 18 of them. Do you have any?"
He was taken aback:"Yes, but I threw them away early and didn't have that many."
"Ah, you don't even have 18 small red flowers? You can't compete with me."
"What's so special about these little flowers compared to your admissions letter from清华大学?"
「……I think I can find something more impressive than your flower collection."
Now what should I do? This guy is really serious about pursuing us!
I suddenly thought of小猪佩奇 and mentioned it:
"Asking Piggy, have you seen that character?"
He shook his head, still confused.
"I'm exhausted from all this. If we were to marry, our kids wouldn't even be able to talk because they'd never hear me say anything interesting."
"He's going to be a terrible father."
"Can I see your kids?"
"Yes."
"Maybe...we could try."
I quickly helped him realize how bad an idea that was and told him to back off: "That's not right. Let's just part ways."
As soon as I finished, I turned my head and walked away without looking back.
13. Escaping with Lip Balm
The man who has been stalking me for the past few days finally managed to get close to me again.
He approached me at a肯德基 restaurant on the 2nd of February, which was during his summer vacation after graduating from college.
I had run out of steam and stopped in front of him because I had been trying to avoid him all day, even when I was waiting for my train.
The restaurant was empty except for one customer: a high school student working on their homework. Another guy sitting across from them looked like he might be around 20 years old and was staring at his phone. That must have been the man who had been chasing me!
I approached him to say goodbye when suddenly I heard the high school student shouting behind me:
"秦梓涵!"
That's when I realized what was happening.
"I'm sorry, what did you just say?"
"You? Qin Zidian?"
"What are you doing here?"He said with a smile, "I'm not looking for a girlfriend, I just need you to do my homework."
I: "…"
He pushed a math exercise book towards me. "Third unit, second class, please!"
I opened the book and mom's! Stereometry!
I felt dizzy and my head was spinning. This 3D geometry is really hard in high school!
I saw the boy waiting for me with one foot expecting me to start, I clenched my fists and didn't want him to see me get it wrong.
But I just poured water on myself, looking confident but actually helpless.
Oh well, let's just say that if I don't know how to do it, who else will? It's not like I have a diamond in front of me!
"I don't know how to do this."
The boy seemed to expect as much and continued pushing his homework towards me. "What about this one?"
I stared at him with black lines on my face: "Friend, when I was reading literature major, you're reading biology. You won't even know where to start."
「……"
"You should just ask for help from your friends who are good at searching for answers or something. They're more reliable than me anyway."
He laughed hysterically behind me. "Do you know what a grasshopper is?"
I froze.
He continued: "It's an animal, you're as dumb as it is."
I was going crazy!
I raised my arm to gesture. "How dare you talk like that! If I'm not good at it, don't expect me to be better just because I read literature major! You were just a wet wipe when I played with mud back then."
「……"
"I may not have direction, but at least I can find my way."
I: "…"
I sighed and got angry. The boy started talking again: "Brother, you're staring at Lianwen sister, stop it!"
I was shocked: "Brother?"
"It's true! I just tested your girlfriend candidate's intelligence level." He said, then started cleaning up his things. "I'm going, let the two of you talk."
The boy had barely walked out the door when he shouted excitedly again: "Oh! You're him! You're him!"
I spun around and almost fainted.
How did Zhao Linhao get here?!
"Hmm, I'm a celebrity. Brother, I'm a celebrity. This is true!"
He stared at me with wide eyes. "Thank you.""The amount of urea in your saliva exceeds the standard." Zhao Linuo walked up to me, his hands clasped behind his back and staring at him.
"Hey!"
"Heh, grasshopper!" Gao Zhenxu raised an eyebrow and smiled slightly, "You were born because of your dad's mistake with cell division. What kind of man can turn out like you? I can pay to check if you have Y chromosome only without a Y chromosome stalk."
"You you you!" He was stunned and couldn't speak a complete sentence.
"You're right," he stuttered.
Wanting to scold, the main protagonist is actually strong.
High school student rushed over, eyes fixed on Gao Zhenxu without blinking: "Wow wow wow, it's so cool! You're a CEO!"
For his younger brother's weird behavior, as an older brother, he couldn't help but be infuriated, but also couldn't scold Gao Zhenxu, only to bow down.
"Is this the kind of hero who saves people with swords?" A child stared at Gao Zhenxu with wide eyes: "What's wrong with women being bullied? This is the right way!"
"..."
Gao Zhenxu was helping me scold him, but my heart was like a mirror, if I went back home, I'd be just another mouse in the cat's den.
I quietly retreated behind Zhao Linuo, measured the distance to the door from here and decided on an opportunity to escape.
As soon as he took his first step, he was grabbed by Gao Zhenxu's elbow and pulled back.
I spoke in a negotiating tone: "Gao Zhenxu, don't talk about this."
"You dare to hide me while arranging a date?"
The child saw this scene and was stunned: "Idol, what are you doing?"
Zhao Linuo squeezed me tightly: "I forgot to introduce her. This is my wife."
I made a mistake again, I was so stupid that I thought I could hide my movements, Zhao Linuo was a person with divine abilities in Y City.
We walked out of KFC and saw an empty road.
"You parked your car?"
"I followed you on the metro."If previously translated content is also given, use it as reference.
Combine multiple empty lines in a row into a single one.
"Not allowed!" he said with a fierce tone.
"Do people need to keep their promises?" I bowed down with my left foot on the ground and drew circles around me. "Dai Heng is so pitiful now, being forced by a loner to watch his sister's 'Isn't My Sister Possible to Be That Cute?'"
「……"
The third blind date was a surgeon, scheduled at a location not far from each other, three stations away on the subway.
Today, there was some warm sunshine but I hadn't walked to the subway station yet, and the CEO took off his black leather coat, revealing the ridiculous sweater I had knitted for him.
I hastily wrapped my clothes around him. "This sweater is ugly, let's put it back on."
He refused and even didn't mind: "No way, it's quite good-looking! Besides, as long as I wear it, I'll be okay anyway."
"Okay? Okay? Whatever you say, but..."
"Don't say anything else, hurry up!"
I looked at his back, which was very straight, and my eyes got a little moist.
I hurried after him: "Old Man, wait for me."
We arrived at the subway station just in time to miss one train, with another six minutes before the next one came.
Riding the subway together was unheard of. The old saying goes that once you've seen it, there's nothing new left to see. We took advantage of this rare opportunity to take a photo together as a memory.
I held up my phone, but unfortunately, my arm was too short, and I couldn't even capture his face. Even if I stood on tiptoes, all I could get was my messy hair in the picture.
I searched through my bag until I found a selfie stick, which was old and had lost its flexibility but still worked somehow.
I handed him the phone to look at it, and he turned away dead-set not to see me. Since he wouldn't look, I took a photo of myself with just his side face in the frame.
"Quickly put it away! The subway is entering the station!"
He reminded me, but I couldn't stop staring at that long selfie stick anyway.
In front of us, Zhao Lin Ao suddenly turned around, and because we were so close, his hat got stuck on top of the selfie stick. Then we stared at each other for a while, frozen in place.
"Old Man, this time not only did the stick get stuck to your face, but your hat is also stuck!"
His eyes turned darker, and the air around him got more tense.
I was frantic, my face sweating like crazy as I tried to pull out the selfie stick. But no matter how hard I pulled, it got even tighter.
Drip-drip-drip-drip... 
The subway doors opened.
"Go first," he said.
And in front of a crowd of people, I held onto the selfie stick with his ridiculous sweater and hat still stuck to it, entering the subway.I raised my foot and pushed it hard to lift him up.
"Qin Yuwei, what are you doing? You're choking me!
"Boss, bear with me for a minute, I've found the problem."
Zhang Biao's hand shot out to grab the selfie stick: "Ah ah! Let go, let go, I'm suffocating!
*dropping sound*
The door closed.
"Stop it!" he shouted loudly, drawing attention from other passengers.
Now everyone's phones are put away, staring at us both."
"Old man, just a little longer, we'll be done soon."
My arm was throbbing with pain, but I couldn't help feeling like victory was within reach. I gritted my teeth and continued what I was doing.
"Ah ah ah!" He started coughing violently.
"Do you feel that pain? Fine, I won't pull it anymore."
Listening to his coughs, I was terrified. My heart was racing.
Just as I thought of giving up, the thread finally gave in and let go of my selfie stick.
Whew...I took a deep breath: "See, boss, the stick is taken down."
"But why do you feel like it's still stuck?"
"Huh? Why would I feel that way?"
"Oh no, where did he put his hat?"
"Ah ah ah."
He started coughing again, and this time it was even more violent.
The problem is, my neck wasn't small enough, so if he held it too tight....
I couldn't believe it. Was he going to suffocate?
I panicked and bent down to pick him up, holding his legs open wide: "Ah ah ah, boss, do you feel better now."
"Let go of me."
My eyes welled up with tears: "I won't let go! If I do, you'll be strangled!
Just then, a passenger tried to calm me down: "Ma'am, please stop. 
But I was too distraught to listen: "Don't leave me! Someone help me! Save my husband!"
My sobs echoed through the carriage, drawing attention from other passengers.
Before long, a line of security guards rushed over: "Who's calling for help? What's going on?"
I clutched his legs tightly, sobbing uncontrollably: "It's me. I need you to save my husband! He's choking!"Security personnel were shocked, and simultaneously expressed their helplessness. "Miss, you can let go now," one of them said.
I continued to sob uncontrollably, "You guys are all looking at me like this? Are you saying I'm nothing?"
I was holding my breath, looking up, and found the CEO staring at me, revealing a good-tempered smile on his face.
"One of your husbands is 186 cm tall," one of the security personnel said.
I nodded, "He's two centimeters shorter than that, he's 188 cm tall."
"His door is as high as that? You're worried about being strung up?"
"..."
I looked up and found it to be true. Embarrassing...
The security personnel were staring at the CEO, one by one saying he was familiar with him.
I hastily covered Zhao Jinghao's face with my hand, taking rapid breaths, "All handsome guys have a similar face shape, of course, he must look like me!"
Earlier that was so embarrassing. If someone had taken a photo of the CEO in public, it would have made headlines again.
"Anyway, Zhao Jinghao wouldn't be able to sit on the bus," one of them muttered.
"But if you're Zhao Jinghao, then you must be recognizable?"
"..."
The moment those words were said, the carriage erupted into chaos. Passengers took out their phones and snapped photos of him in unison.
"You guys recognized the wrong person! Zhao Jinghao is definitely better-looking than my husband!" I desperately tried to cover up.
He took down my hand that was covering his face, holding both hands around his chest, "You can take pictures of me. When you release them, please blur out my wife's face."
"Ah, he must be the Zhao Jinghao! This is indeed him, unbelieveable!" A passenger exclaimed.
The CEO: "...I didn't need to say that"
Tempted by the commotion caused by his clothes being stuck in the train door, everyone swarmed towards him, wanting to take a photo with him.
He held my hand and gently pressed my head against his chest, reminding passengers not to squeeze me.
Finally exiting the train, I arrived at our last stop for dating – the coffee shop. I was worried that Zhao Jinghao would get upset if things didn't go well, so I made sure he waited outside while I went in first.
He agreed after some hesitation.
"Zhao-san?"
I turned around, "Wu doctor? How are you here?"
"I came to find a date for you, and you aren't here," he said.
I suddenly had an idea: "The girl who was dating is Qin Zidian. Why did you know that?"
He nodded, "Yes, I did."
I: "..."
Apparently, Wu doctor also liked photoshopping pictures…If previously translated content is also given, use it as reference.
===== CONTENT TO TRANSLATE =====
I lifted my hand and stroked his head: "Don't be mad, you're doing very well today, I was waiting for you outside with a 'be good' attitude."
"Not yet, I've humiliated you, so pay me back."
He actually played the baby! A CEO who plays the baby!
This time's trend isn't "Zhao Ting Hua sitting on the metro", nor is it "Zhao Ting Hua's clothes getting caught in the metro door". Instead it's "Zao Ting Hua gave me design inspiration".
That's what a famous clothing designer said, he praised the CEO's jacket saying its style is unique and might be a new fashion trend!
Netizens kept saying they couldn't hold back their excitement. Some even sent a picture of the game "Yin Yang Xiao Ru" with the caption: I don't have that kind of physique, wearing it might look like this.
……'
Recently, Zao Ting Hua wanted to build a vacation resort in the south.
I was confused, there are mountains in the south, so why not build it by the sea?
But when he told me the land needed auction, I felt like finding a treasure!
So the phrase "food is worth fighting for" really works!
Half an hour past eleven at night, I was lying in bed watching dramas while the CEO was still sitting at his desk working.
A short while later, he came over with a puzzled expression holding his phone.
"Have you finished work?" I asked.
"No, I couldn't take it anymore. I have to call someone and yell at them. If not, my throat might be hoarse."
「……"
For the poor employee who was about to get scolded, I silently mourned for three seconds.
"Did you sleep?" he asked.
"I'm fine, what time are you up?"
"What's your mentor? I saw your travel report and it's quite good. I think you should write an examination report instead."
The CEO chuckled and said: "You can have the expense money; just buy two boxes of brain gold yourself."
My CEO has a mouth like a gunpowder barrel, staying on one side is the only way to avoid getting hit.
A short while later, someone sent me a message.
Who is it?
I was confused, but I couldn't resist my curiosity and agreed anyway.
A few seconds passed before they came with a message: "Oh no, oh no! After a good night's sleep, one phone call nearly threw me away!" [Crying][Crying] Can you please give me a gentle breeze by the pillow for me? 
My response was silent.
Since the report was trash, the CEO decided to drive himself to go again. 
Actually, I also took a look at that report earlier, it wasn't bad even if I didn't understand it well. All things considered, it was quite good.
The examination report was scheduled soon after.
The journey is very far, just driving one way takes twice the oil.
We set off in the morning and have been going non-stop since then.
After a few hours, we finally had some signs of approaching the village.
I comforted him, telling him to rest because it's already over ten hours of travel.I blamed myself, saying "It's all my fault. If I had a driver's license, we could take turns driving."
He laughed, saying "I thought you were going to scold me for not bringing my car."
Okay, it's not scolding, it's that I never even thought of having a private driver in the first place, and now when you mention it, I feel bad about not thinking of it earlier .....
We'd been sitting in the car for so long, and my back hurt from it. I got up to stretch, and Zhao Jianhao came out saying he wanted to use the restroom."
This scene was a bit like the last time there was an incident with wild boars ....
We searched high and low for ten or fifteen minutes, but eventually found a public toilet. It looked like it hadn't been used in ages, with spider webs everywhere.
Our leader came out of the toilet looking rather imperial, hesitating between going back to the throne room and not wanting to return. He finally couldn't resist the overwhelming stench and carefully made his way into the toilet stall."
I waited outside for a while but didn't see him come out, and eventually his voice came from behind a wall saying "Rainy, can you bring me some paper?"
"Yes, okay." I thought about grabbing my bag to get some paper, but suddenly realized I had forgotten it in the rush this morning .....
Is there any on the car?
"You wait a minute," I said, and then quickly ran back to look inside. Even the seat was torn open, but there was no sign of any toilet paper whatsoever!
I went back outside and nervously explained "Zhao Jianhao, that...that paper...." 
"...you know, you must have remembered to bring it earlier."
"I forgot ....."
I carefully peeked into the stall again, and he looked at me with a scowl. 
"You absolutely must get me some paper!" He growled.
I was terrified, my back was sweating profusely. I didn't dare annoy him anymore, so I rushed out to find some paper.
But in this desolate wilderness, there wasn't a single leaf or tree branch around. Where had the paper gone? 
Ugh, it's really frustrating ....
Wait, what about branches?
Yes! 
So I bent down and broke off some of that last tree's branches, then cut them into small pieces.
I brought those back to Zhao Jianhao, who picked one up and looked at it uncertainly before tossing it away with a mighty roar: "No way!
But I explained, "It may not look like it now, but people in the past used to use branches to wipe themselves clean just fine. They lived just as well. ....."
He rubbed his temples, looking uninterested anymore. 
"I don't have that skill," he said.
I went off to find a larger leaf that could be used for wiping. 
It didn't take long for me to find one of those strange leaves. The soft spines on the back reminded me of cucumber leaves. The edges were rough enough to be scratchy, but it should work as a makeshift wipe. 
I handed him the leaf, saying "This one might work."
He took it reluctantly, still looking disapproving, but just used it to wipe himself clean after all. 
"But you know which tree this leaf came from?" he asked gruffly!
"I found it on that last tree I broke off," I replied.
He looked unimpressed. "You find a tree for me? That's not right!"
"My apologies," I said with an apologetic tone, trying to avoid any further scolding."
I went back out again but couldn't find a suitable leaf anywhere else. It seemed like this wilderness was devoid of paper altogether. 
Aww, man...If previously translated content is also given, use it as reference.
Combine multiple empty lines in a row into a single one.
I was shocked and my heart was racing: "I forgot to tell you, the back of the leaf has some thorns…"
He didn't respond to me, carelessly throwing away what he had just picked up, and continued to hold the second leaf to rub it.
This time he seemed smart, holding the smooth side up.
However, after rubbing for only half a minute, he froze in place like a statue.
"What's wrong?" I asked.
"He poked a hole through it…"
"...""
He had硬着头皮上完厕所的赵霆皓's face was already red with anger, and his eyes were bulging out of their sockets.  He didn't say another word to me anymore, just walked ahead in silence.
First he went to the creek to wash his hands for about twenty minutes, then carefully leaned over to sniff at it again, furrowing his brow and continuing to wash for another ten or so minutes.
I looked around and discovered a soap tree! To make up for what I had done wrong earlier, I hastily plucked one of its leaves and handed it to him.
Even though he was still angry with me, he finally agreed to let me lead the way because he wanted to enjoy the scenery.
However, as soon as he started talking, his voice sounded like he was being tortured: "If you had brought a sheet, I wouldn't need this at all!"
"Yes, yes, it's my fault. It's my mistake."  He couldn't even control his anger anymore; I just kept quiet and followed behind him.
When we finally arrived at our destination, there was a loud noise like a firework, then the sound of drums beating.
Covering my ears as I got off the bus, I couldn't believe what I was seeing. The project manager from the resort was standing in front of us, waving a whip and welcoming us with a loud cheer!
What kind of celebration is this?
It was already seven o'clock, but it was still daylight outside because it was winter.
The night atmosphere at the mountain was cold and damp, so my boss and I quickly retreated to our bed for the night.  The room's five light bulbs lit up like fireflies, making a cozy glow.
I thought that after washing my face, I could fall asleep right away, but my biological clock told me it was still too early.
Alright, let's just play with my phone for a bit.
However…
I didn't make a mistake, did I? It turned out to be 2G internet?
"Boss, maybe you should give up on this resort project?"
"Oh? How come?"
"I mean, where will the tourists go if there is no signal?"
He was silent for half a minute before responding.
"Do you think about it now?"
"Yeah, I haven't thought about it at all."
"..."Rain, I feel like my face is itching and my fingers too, and there's a little bit of itchiness on my neck.
He started scratching as he said it.
I took a closer look, and couldn't help jumping back with a fright: "Bureaucrat, you've got hives! You're red and swollen!"
"What?!",
"Probably an allergic reaction!",
He was incredulous: "I didn't eat anything, how could I have reacted like this?"
I quickly jumped off the bed and put on my shoes: "Wait, wait, I'll go find someone to look at it."
I soon found someone in charge and showed him the hives: "The head of the department said you're allergic to lacquer."
Lacquer?
He had never come into contact with lacquer before!
I suddenly thought of that broken tree branch that I had dropped earlier!
I realized he was thinking of it too, but hadn't looked at me yet, and I felt a surge of resentment in my back.
To avoid his intense gaze like an animal's, I could only pretend not to see him and ask the person in charge: "Why didn't you react like that?"
"Everyone's body is different.",
"If it bothers you, should we give you medicine?",
"But where are we going to get medicine now?"
The person walked away, and I was even more afraid of looking at Zhao Glanbao.
For a while, the room was quiet, he sighed and pulled over the blanket, covering himself up.
I took a deep breath: "Glanbao…"
He didn't respond.
"Glano..."
Still not responding.
"Old man..." 
Finally: "Stop talking, stop making any noise, let me rest."
If only he would listen to me, we could discuss it further. So I gathered my courage and leaned in front of him: "Are you very itchy?"
His face looked even more severe than before, his eyes were squished into a small slit due to the swelling, and his entire face looked like it had been made of bread.
"Don't talk to me anymore, I just want to sleep. Maybe if I sleep, the itch will go away." He said as soon as he finished and closed his eyes.
I kept quiet and leaned against the bedhead, watching him.
Suddenly, an idea came to me: saliva can relieve itching.
So I dipped my finger in my own saliva and gently applied it to his affected area.
He opened his eyes: "What did you do? It's kind of soothing."If previously translated content is also given, use it as reference.
Combine multiple empty lines in a row into a single one.
「口水，听说有止痒效果."
霸总：「……滚!""
Because the CEO was severely allergic, this state couldn't be worked on properly, and I was worried about his physical health, so he left for home the next day.
He lay in bed for two days with water on the pillow, his rash subsiding significantly, and his face's redness also improved considerably.
He suddenly sat down beside him, put his feet into cotton socks, hesitated for a while, and then picked up the report that was criticized by him yesterday, which he had kept silent about.
Actually, in recent times, Chai Lao and Hong Hao were competing fiercely over that piece of land, and finally, Chai Lao won the bid, making the CEO laugh wildly.
Everyone said this was a "slip-up" in Zhao Li Hao's business competition.
I intended to comfort him, but he told me that he actually gave up on that piece of land, pretending it was Chai Lao.
Okay, I guess the CEO doesn't need my concern after all.
This project is over, and Zhao Li Hao is no longer busy like before, so he has time to spend with me at home.
「Remember to leave one last mouthful for me."""
I leaned against him on the couch while watching TV.
「Uh-huh." He was looking at stocks while talking and also shoveled a potato chip into his mouth.
This drama's female lead is too pitiful, the scriptwriter is so harsh! I watched it with tears streaming down my face.
 „What kind of drama makes you cry like this?""
He said that and leaned forward to look at the screen, then was silent for half a minute before saying：“《媳妇别哭》…emmm… The title itself sounds like a guy crying a lot of female tears…”
 „The life of a wealthy wife is really sad!"" I couldn't help but sigh.
 Zhao Li Hao：「……""
I realized I said the wrong thing and quickly added：「Lucky I'm your wife, haha."'
But I found out that he didn't even leave any potato chip for me：「Is there anything left? Don't worry, I'll buy a lot more!"
 „Don't! You promised to keep one for me, it's not the same as buying new ones!""
 „Then spit it out and give it to me?" He hesitated before trying to comfort me by putting his hand on my shoulder.
I was still mad and sat up straight：「You're not being serious, are you? You're a CEO, how can you be so careless?""
He saw me getting angry and quickly calmed me down with gentle words：「Rainy, don't get upset, I'll buy all the chips you want!"
 „No way! You promised to keep one for me, that means buying new ones is different!""
 「If you spit it out, I can give you more."" He wanted to lift his hand to touch my shoulder, but I pushed him away.
I said goodbye and walked back up the stairs with him still following behind me, saying that he was sorry and didn't mean not to care about me.
As I turned around to see what I could do, I heard little Xia's soft voice calling out：“Mommy, Mommy!"
I rolled my eyes at Zhao Li Hao and hurried downstairs to see little Xia, who was still following him.“Sister, what’s wrong with you and Uncle? I can tell by looking at you that something is off between you two,” little Cheng stared at me with a keen eye.
“You uncle is not someone to be trusted. Little Cheng doesn’t want to be like him,” he emphasized.
“Hmm!” he nodded emphatically. “Uncle is a pigsty.”
Zhao Lin Hao:「……”
Little Cheng pulled out an exercise book from his backpack and handed it to me, asking me to help him explain the problems.
I glanced at the cover of the exercise book, which had big letters reading “Children’s Arithmetic”. I felt a surge of confidence thinking that I could handle this since it was just children's arithmetic. I mean what's not easy about that? 
“Which problem is this?” I asked.
He pointed to one and said: “Look at this one.”
I read through the problem, and my mind did a bit of thinking before I realized it wasn’t too hard. It was just simple math.
I explained a few more problems to him, and he was full of praise, saying that I was good at them.
Just as I was daydreaming, I got completely stumped on one question.
The problem went like this: 
There were 1.2 times the number of chairs as desks in the classroom, but some desks from another class came over, leaving…… how many more desks and chairs did they take?
I couldn’t believe it. This was for kids! I wouldn’t know if I had to do something like that myself. But little Cheng looked at me with hope in his eyes.
So I only reluctantly said: “Little Cheng, where is the focus of this question?”
He thought for a moment before confidently saying: “1.2.”
I shook my head. “That can’t be right. It’s ‘can you solve it’.”
“Why?”
“Because if little Cheng just counted directly and subtracted, he would say the desks are 1.2 times more, but that wouldn’t be fair. If he had to go through all those steps just because his uncle wanted him to get a complicated answer, then he's being bullied or something like that. At this point, we should choose not to help him. Humans need to know when to say no, and little Cheng knows the answer anyway.”
He suddenly looked enlightened, exclaimed: “I know it now! The answer is you can’t!”
“Wow, clever!”
Zhao Lin Hao couldn't hold back a laugh anymore in the corner.
I rolled my eyes at him. “Laugh it off? You go ahead and try it yourself!”
He smiled warmly, then picked up the exercise book and flipped through it for just a few seconds before saying: “2 desks, 6 chairs.”
I looked stunned.
It seemed like my intelligence had been brutally crushed now...
Zhao Lin Hao finished helping little Cheng solve that problem, so I couldn’t help but feel a sense of disappointment. “Little friend shouldn't be doing these advanced problems at all,” I sighed. 
“Yeah, he wants to do them because the preschool isn’t interesting enough for him.” The boss explained.
 “This is why we can’t even teach elementary school kids right now…”I：「……」This family of mine, how did they all end up being so intelligent?
Not that I still have a temper, I mustn't talk to him.
Suddenly Cold Xiang rushed in, excitedly shouting he wanted me to eat roasted meat.
As soon as I heard it was roasted meat, my eyes lit up and I agreed on the spot.
Cold Xiang then ran up to the front of the group, saying I also wanted to go!
“No way, you haven't finished writing your assignment yet, don't even think about going!” Zhao Lin Bao said sternly.
“But all that's left is what I'm not good at, please let me go, uncle!”
Cold Xiang sighed and shook his head. “I guess I'll have to go with you then, just in case I can help you with your assignment.”
Zhao Lin Bao waved his hand dismissively. “Don't make it so complicated, these questions are easy for you anyway…”
A fierce gaze.
“Although I know them all, but I'm sure you won't explain them clearly enough …”
「……”
This roast meat shop is really popular, people are streaming in and out.
We followed the waiter's lead into the private room, this should be small program Ye Xiang's first time eating roasted meat, he looked around curiously.
I was originally trying to sit far away from Zhao Lin Bao, but he insisted on sitting next to me anyway.
Oh well, I just won't pay attention to him then.
The aroma of the roasted meat wafted out and filled my senses, my mouth began to water uncontrollably.
“Rain, what do you want? Let me help you cook it.” Cold Xiang asked me, “Chicken ribs? Chicken wings or beef?”
“I'll have chicken wings.”
Just as I was enjoying myself, a pair of chopsticks appeared in front of me, holding chicken wings.
I turned my head away and said, “You can eat them yourself!”
“Are you still angry at me?”
Cold Xiang's eyes widened in surprise. “Did the two of you fight again?”
“Yes.” I nodded.
“Ha ha, let's celebrate! It's a miracle we're both so good at arguing.” Cold Xiang laughed and began digging into my plate, “Come on, eat more, if you're too hungry to argue with him, it'll be even better for you.”
Zhao Lin Bao's face darkened, he rolled his eyes. “Rain, you should stand up to him too…”
“Don't tease me anymore!”
Cold Xiang saw us arguing and burst out laughing again. “You two are always so good at fighting! Congratulations on having a fight today as well.”"Don't, I'm coming!"
"Come on, you're frozen out of paying, or I'll come!"
"I was only frozen last night, and it's because I invited you myself, so it has to be me who comes!"
Zhao Linbao and Lü Hán were not letting each other off the hook, and they pushed and shoved in front of the payment counter.
"We're three people from Zhao family, and there's only one of us with the surname Lü, so it should be me who pays."
"No, no, no, that can't be. This meal is too complicated to settle, and besides, I invited Rain Vegeta over, you two just happened to come along."
"You have to be frugal, or Lü Hán will freeze your credit card again!"
Zhao Linbao said, pulling out his phone to scan the QR code, but Lü Hán got anxious and grabbed the phone away, slamming it to the ground, where the screen shattered into five pieces.
Everyone turned their heads in surprise.
"Look at you breaking your phone, so I'll come instead."
Lü Hán just managed to grab the phone back when Zhao Linbao quickly snatched it again, smashing it to pieces.
The customers all gasped in shock.
"I'll pay with my card."
Zhao Linbao took out his card as he told the cashier, but Lü Hán immediately snatched it away and snapped it in two.
"This isn't worth anything - is this how you two are going to waste your money?"
Rain Vegeta rushed over, grabbing the phone and card before Zhao Linbao could react.
"Stop fighting!"
Zhao Linbao pulled Rain Vegeta behind him, saying, "Don't worry about it, this has nothing to do with you."
Rain Vegeta just stood there, looking unimpressed.
Lü Hán saw him and quickly snatched the bank card from the cashier's hand, snapping it in two before Zhao Linbao could react.
"Can you gentlemen please pay up?"
The cashier was frustrated, "There are still customers waiting in line!"
Someone suddenly piped up, "We don't mind, let's watch a show first."
The atmosphere fell silent.
Finally, the cashier broke the silence with a forced smile, "Okay, gentlemen, please pay up."
"Who's going to pay now?"
Rain Vegeta sighed, saying, "I'll pay this time."
Zhao Linbao stood up, saying, "You're not getting paid for that."
Lü Hán and Zhao Linbao started arguing again.
"I'll pay," Rain Vegeta said firmly.
"I'll do it," Lü Hán said, but Zhao Linbao snatched the card away, snapping it in two.
"Can you two please just settle up already?"
Zhao Linbao took out his phone to scan the QR code and quickly finished paying with a swipe of his card.
"Thanks for understanding."

My dream has come true.Raindrop.
「……」
"Raindrop, you're so big and loud!" 
I remained silent, actually I didn't know. 
Recently I've been feeling weird inside, and can't shake off this uneasy feeling, even had a vision again yesterday and it's getting more frequent. And then I realized that this situation is similar to the time we went back to our previous life together with Raindrop, just like that he left me abruptly without any explanation... Maybe Azure didn't accept my new life without him? 
"Raindrop, what are you thinking about? Why not talk?" 
I heard his voice and suddenly tears fell down, I turned around and hugged him. 
He gently tapped on my back with his fingers: "Why did you cry again? Don't be angry with me." 
I shook my head: "No." 
He leaned down and kissed the corner of my lips: "Raindrop don't doubt my heart, I really love you." 
I asked out the long-held question: "You like me because I'm a heroine?" 
"Because you're good, because you're bad," he said seriously. 
I laughed: "That's a weird answer!" 
"Because it's you, little idiot," he said after saying that and kissed me deeply.
I closed my eyes to feel his gentle touch, but in my heart I felt bitter and worried about how long this happiness could last... 
……...
Azure got back into his busy work mode again. I put some warm water for the small turtle, and gave it a tiny shrimp for food. The little guy was so happy that it started spitting bubbles everywhere.
It's already 6 pm in the afternoon, but the boss is still not back. Looks like he's going to be working late again 
I sat on the couch with the little turtle and suddenly felt dizzy all of a sudden, I couldn't help feeling anxious and scared 
Oh no, oh no! 
I stared at myself who was about to fall down, for a moment I felt a deep sadness inside 
Azure... I really want to see Azure...
When I woke up again, I had no choice but to quickly grab my bag and head to the office.
At the door of the CEO's office, I tidied up my mind, just as I was about to enter, I saw Wang Xinyu standing there, messing around with files in her desk drawer. 
"Hey, what are you doing?" 
I shouted from across the glass door: "What's going on?!"She quickly slammed the drawer shut, covering her hands behind her back, and asked, "General Mrs., how did you get here? Are you looking for General?"
"I asked you what you're doing!" I said firmly.
"I wasn't doing anything," she replied. "I was just sent by General to pick up some files."
"What files?" I said, grabbing her hand as she tried to cover it.
"It's none of your business," she lied.
I grabbed the file from her hands and pulled it towards myself in the struggle. As I looked through the gap, I saw the words "Wind Film".
Suddenly, her phone on the table rang out, a voice call from Wang Xipei. She quickly reached for it, but I snatched it away first, pressing the answer button, which was Wang Xipei's voice: "Did you get it? Be careful not to get caught!"
Wang Xipei's face turned white at once. I lost control of my anger and hit her with a slap. Then I grabbed her hand again: "Come on, let's go see Zhao Linhao!"
"What are you doing?" she asked.
When we saw Zhao Linhao arrive, Wang Xipei burst into tears immediately. I thought this situation was bad for our green tea girl pairing. So, I rushed over to him and pitied him: "Boss, she's wronging me!"
Wang Xipei stared at me in shock: "Zhao Linhao, don't believe her, it was clearly her who hit me."
"It was an accident," she said pitifully.
"You! You!" she shouted in anger.
"I, I," she stammered. Zhao Linhao just stood there in silence. I was taken aback: did he really let Wang Xipei come here to pick up the files? But no, that wouldn't explain why there was a voice call from him earlier.
"Rainy, it's really me who sent her," Zhao Linhao said quietly, "don't blame her."
"I'm not going anywhere!" I said firmly.
I knew in my heart that Wang Xipei must have been hiding something. This reminded me of the novel at the end, where Chipeng used underhanded methods to win a project, causing Harmony Group's strength to decline and selling off several stores to cover the losses.
Is this going to be some setup? Is it just Wang Xipei?
"Rainy, you can go back now,"
He raised his voice so suddenly that I was startled.
He paused for a moment, his voice softening: "Rainy, you can go back."I said it and pushed him out of the room.
Zhao Huan皓, you're just a big idiot king pig! I'll never bother you again, hahaha!
Although I'm currently in a hot temper, I hesitated for a moment before coming to Xiancang Lou downstairs for the sake of弘皓 Group's future.
"I want to see the CEO."
"Excuse me, ma'am, do you have an appointment?"
"None." 
"That's not good. Ma'am, doesn't have an appointment is not allowed to meet our CEO."
"Just tell the CEO Zhao Huan皓's wife came to find him, surname Qin."
He finally understood after I explained it to her and then told me that he was going to send me up.
I arrived when he was already drinking red sorrel plum tea.
"Little girl, what brings you here?" He seemed quite happy when he saw me.
I blurted out: "I heard you and Zhao Huan are fighting over a 'Wind Run Films' project."
He didn't hesitate and admitted it right away.
"Oh? I hear the investment is pretty big." 
I thought about speaking up, but decided to calm down first and explore the situation a bit more.
But he surprisingly started talking: "Xie Pool just told me that little girl is so pure-hearted, even bending the rules can be tiring."
I clenched my fists and growled: "Low!"
"Low?" He laughed out loud. 
"You're not low, I'm just protected very well by Zhao Huan. We block all the dirtiness in the world, that's why you have such pure and clear eyes." 
I was taken aback: "What do you mean?"
"He remembers that time when big star Lin Yue did the 'Fleeting Joy' drama event. Zhao Huan is much more clever than us; we didn't notice how obvious it was to watch out for!"
Hands? What hands?
I only remembered him warning her once in private during a commercial launch event!
He just laughed: "Don't you know that she's been hiding lately?" 
"Snow concealment?"
"So, if your imagination isn't going to go far enough..."
My body started shaking uncontrollably when I heard his words; I won't be deceived by something so simple as snow concealment!
What did the CEO do exactly? 
He took a sip of tea and then said: "There's one more thing. Your two classmates, who aren't related, decided to bother Zhao Huan. Now they're in jail!"If previously translated content is also given, use it as reference.
Combine multiple empty lines in a row into a single one.
「对了，还有那两个绑架犯……」
「够了！别说了.」
不是的，我不相信！这不是我认识的赵霆皓！
「真相猛然浮出水面，是不是难以接受？你也不想想，能坐上弘皓集团总裁位置的人，有哪个不是狠角色？」他叹了口气，「但我不得不佩服他，仔细算来他才 26 岁吧，啧啧啑，不得了。小姑娘，我劝你还是继续待在赵霆皓给你建造的象牙塔里吧，什么都不要想去看清，什么都不要想去琢磨透.」
「既然知道他是这样的人，那你为什么还要让你侄女去当他助理？」
「侄女.\"」他笑，「对，干侄女。呵呵，蠢女人，为了得到赵霆皓，她什么都愿意干.」
我身体止不住颤抖，最不能直视的也许就是人心了……
我走的时候，王总还对我说：「说实话，我很喜欢你，毕竟你曾叫过我一声哥，给我带来过温暖.\""
我走在街上，天空乌沉沉的，我看着鳞次栉比的高楼，看着车水马龙人来人往，仿佛感受到这座城市有力的呼吸……一切都是那么真实。
真实得惊悚，让人发毛。
路过一扇玻璃门，反射出我的倒影。我凑上前去瞧自己的眼睛，真的很纯净很澄澈吗？
还没搞清楚这个问题，我就看见玻璃门反射出一个熟悉的身影。
他缓步靠近我：「雨薇.」
我转过身去面对着他，仔细观察他的双眼，像璀璨的星？像秋晨的雾？不，都不是，是幽邃的深潭，是无底的黑海！
他的眼睛倒映着我的脸，我想看清他眸子深处究竟隐藏着什么东西。
能坐上弘皓集团总裁位置的人，有哪个不是狠角色？
脑海里闪过王总刚才说的话，我忽然不敢逼视眼前这个英俊的男人了。
「雨薇.\"」他欲拉我的手，我心中生出一阵恐惧，快速把手背到身后。
他被我躲开的动作刺痛了，低哑着声音：「雨薇，是我的错，你不要用这种表情看我好不好？在那种情况下，就算知道她手里的那份文件是假的也不能说.I want to thank you, if not for you, that file would have been taken by her.\"」
「假的？\""
所以他一开始就知道王歆池图谋不轨。
「雨薇我们回家好不好？」」他语气几近哀求."""
我看着他幽暗到无际的瞳仁：「你的眼睛……"""
「我的眼睛？\""
「好像寒夜.\"」我怆然补充道，「凄骨的寒夜.\""""
```
「雨薇你别这样……」他眼眶迅速泛红."""
「霆皓，你是我一个字一个字创造出来的人啊."""
他悲伤地看着我.
「可是，我怎么觉得自己一丁点儿都不了解你呢？」
他兀地落下两行清泪.I turned around and lifted my feet to walk, but that dizzy feeling hit me again, followed by seeing Zhao Lianbao quickly holding onto me before I fell.
His eyes were full of shock, and he slammed on the brakes, speeding towards the hospital with me inside the car.
Halfway through our journey, I woke up and said, "Stop the car."
"Rainy, let's go to the hospital first?" 
"I'm fine now, just want to get out of the car!"."
He had a pained expression and said, "Rainy..."
"Zhao Lianbao, calm down," I told him.
He looked around again and then spoke carefully, "Okay, Rainy. Remember to hurry back soon, I'm waiting for you." 
I didn't answer, opened the car door, and plunged into the darkness.
The street lamps were just starting to light up, casting a cityscape of fragmented silhouettes. I gazed at the horizon, seeing an impressive skyscraper with "Hongbao Group" emblazoned on its facade.
This building was like its owner, looking down upon the city as if it's the sole ruler of Y City.
I, Rainy Qin, began questioning myself in this world of reality, could I tolerate being with such a man?
Maybe Zhao family mom was right, compared to me, Zhenwen would be more suitable as Zhao Lianbao's wife).
Looking at the night shrouding the city, I was unsure what to do next.
My phone rang, it was Cold Xun.
I assumed it was Zhao Lianbao who called him, so I picked up.
The voice on the other end was excited, "Rainy Rainy, I got the schedule for that kid's trip, the next stop is Zhao Lianbao's ranch. Want to go with me?" 
Cold Xun still didn't know. 
"I won't go,"
"Why not? You like him more than anyone else!" 
"I'm not saying it's that strong, women are always adaptable." I tried to tone down my voice."
"Hey, Rainy, I saw you!" 
"No way, you're just trying to trick me!"
Suddenly, I heard the sound of a car horn behind me and turned around, finding that indeed it was Cold Xun sticking his head out of the window, waving at me.
"Come on, how late is it for you?" 
I sat in the backseat feeling the cool breeze against my face, ignoring the question. 
"We should go sing." He suggested.
I turned to look at him, "Cold Xun, was it Zhao Lianbao who called you?" 
He stopped the car, "Rainy, are we misunderstanding each other again?" 
"I always thought I knew him best."
I took a moment of silence before asking, "Cold Xun, do you know him?"He wasn't a very good person. He paused for a moment, "But if he were a good person, then why would he be sitting on the CEO position of Hong Hua Group right now?"
"Cheng Xiao...".
"He thinks people often define a 'good person' as someone who is virtuous, regardless of whether it's you or Zhao Tian Hua. It's just that they're not good enough." He looked at me seriously, "The world isn't black and white. Zhao Tian Hua is only trying to prevent your purity from being tainted by those dark themes. Why did you leave him and the fairy tale house he built for you?"
"You know what Wang San said to me?" I asked.
He nodded: "The secretary just told us about what happened earlier. Rain, don't blame Zhao Tian Hua for following you around because of his obsessive desire for control. He might be overbearing but it's only because he wants to get closer to you. Who made you always let him feel like he's walking on a tightrope?"
"I'm lost," I said.
"Why do you think he keeps watching you?"
"I sent you home." He hesitated for a moment before saying, "I don't know why I agreed to this. I shouldn't have let you hand yourself over to him like that."
"It's all because of Cheng Xiao...".
"No, it's not Rainy Day 1 or Rainy Day 2. I only want to be good to a girl named Rain."
"If all girls were to change their names to Rain..."
He laughed: "But Rain, you're the one and only for me."
"Cheng Xiao...". I couldn't speak anymore, tears began to fall.
"Who?" he asked.
"Rainy Day. That's who I want."
"I'll take care of all girls named Rain from now on."
"I'm going home," I said, trying to calm down.
Following the familiar path, the road suddenly turned snowy. It was the first snow of this year.
The stars twinkled in the sky, and I breathed a sigh of relief as the flakes fell onto my hands. But before I could see them clearly, they melted away.
It was like they just vanished into thin air.
I felt like my heart had dropped, like a shattered bottle that had sprung open. I ran forward with all my might. I was terrified of fainting. Please give me some time!
Only two minutes of running and it felt like an eternity to me."
The lights of the villa were still on, looking warm and inviting.
I gasped for air as I approached the entrance. There was someone sitting in front of the greenery, looking peaceful.
My eyes welled up with tears, slowly making my way towards him: "CEO...".
He saw me and his expression lit up: "Rainy Day has come back? See? I've been waiting for you. No matter what you do, whether it's go see that disgusting doctor or meet Cheng Xiao, I'll wait for you the same way I did last time."
I couldn't speak anymore, tears were blurring my vision as my body shook uncontrollably. Tears streamed down my face.
"Don't cry, Rain. If you don't want to see me, look at that little turtle, okay?" He said with a smile, then got up and carefully took the big pot of water from his arms and handed it in front of me. "I've changed the water and added lots of shrimp for food. See? It's moving."
"Zhao Tian Hua...Zhou Tian Hua..." I couldn't form any words anymore.
Here is the original content againIf previously translated content is also given, use it as reference.
===== CONTENT TO TRANSLATE =====
He lifted his hand to wipe away my tears in mid-air, then quickly pulled it back again, I cried out and grabbed hold of his cold iron-like hand, "Fool, the weather is so cold, why didn't you stay home instead?"
"I'm afraid I'll miss you coming back…… more afraid that you won't come back." He laughed like a child, "Hehe, lucky you're back. I've placed all your favorite things in front of you, please don't leave me okay?"
When he looked at my expectant yet nervous expression, my heart twisted like a knife, tears welled up again in my eyes, and dropped onto the water bucket he was holding.
I said yes.
He's got red eyes, not able to hide his excitement.
"You look like a snowman, where has your tough CEO persona gone?" I took a deep breath, embracing his arm, "Let's go home."
………
The whole day he kept staring at me, not blinking his eyes even for a second, wherever he went followed by her."
"CEO, I need to go to the bathroom.")
"No problem, you go your way."
I sighed, "My point is can you step out for a bit?"
"He's just afraid that when I'm not paying attention, you'll suddenly leave."
"If you behave like before, even if you're always holding onto me, it's impossible to keep hold of you."
He heard this and was shocked deep in his heart, "Rain Vee, what are you saying?"
I waved my hand dismissively, pretending to be nonchalant, "Just kidding, look how you were startled. Go out, I'm not pulling your leg."
After tricking him into leaving, my face immediately darkened, I really want to tell him everything that happened last time, but thinking of his sad expression, even if I open my mouth, I won't be able to say anything.
As soon as he heard the toilet flush sound, he stood right outside the bathroom door.
I opened it, and he followed me in."
"CEO, why aren't you going to work?"
The company is so busy lately, without him, it's probably very chaotic.
He shook his head, "Not working, I'm wherever you are."
I couldn't do anything but say, "Then let's go to work together."
Finally, we got him to come to the office, the secretary sister was like a savior, immediately handing over the accumulated files that had been piling up all day.
Oh? Where is Wang Xinyue?"
Of course, after yesterday's messy incident, Zhao Linbao definitely won't keep her around the company anymore.
I stayed in the office with him, I didn't dare to leave for a single moment, as soon as he looked away, it was like searching for milk in front of a child.
In the boredom, I began to browse through the magazines on the shelf, there were ten books out of eight of them with Zhao Linbao's face on the cover, either an interview or his story….. just this story was too exaggerated:
"2-year-old math prodigy, 8-year-old middle school student, using 1 yuan in just two months to make a billion" when I saw that, my face turned black and white again, and then seeing "This is like opening a life line? The author doesn't even dare to start playing games with such a big deposit. Anyway, I love this man who stands on the top of the tower".
Here.This guy really has a high-ranking position, I guess the author's promotion at work should come soon enough.
But when I saw the author's name, my eyes almost popped out of their sockets. I'm, Li Mo Morning!
What a waste of his youth, not studying and instead doing something like that! If he keeps going down this path, it won't end well. I took out my phone to educate him on the matter, just as Qin Zidian arrived with a WeChat message: Let's go out, let's have some fun, Liao Chen is inviting guests.
I looked over at the CEO and was about to reject when I received another WeChat from Liao Chen: Rain Yifei, come out, I have something to tell you.
I hesitated for a moment, looking up at the CEO who was still bent over reading files. He then quickly picked up his things as I just stood up, and he asked me where I was going.
"I'm just going out for a bit."
"He wants to go with you."
"Aw, man, I was only going to be out for a little while!" My voice rose in frustration.
He saw my annoyance and smiled with a wounded expression, finally relaxing his tone: "Okay, so come back quickly, I'll wait for you."
I snorted, barely able to keep it down. 
As soon as we left the office, he suddenly called out to me: "Rain Yifei!
I turned around.
"I love you, I'll always love you."
I smiled and turned around to leave the office, tears suddenly falling.
I hadn't told him that I wasn't sleeping much during the day, but when he was whispering softly to me beside the couch as I lay there with my eyes closed, it felt like my heart was about to break.
As soon as I left the company, one eye saw Liao Chen's red Mercedes-Benz.
Qin Zidian waved at me from behind the window.
"What do you want to talk about?" I asked Cold Chen, sitting down in the car.
"Just relax first," he said as he started the engine.
"Come on, tell me what's going on. Gladiolus is waiting for me."
"But I'm waiting for you too." He turned around, "If you leave Gladiolus, let's be together."
I was taken aback.
"Haha, look like you're scared. In reality, I just wanted to invite you out to play."
He then pressed the accelerator hard, "Let's go have fun!
The scenery outside the window moved backward as we drove through a city shrouded in a thin mist that covered buildings in an eerie haze. 
I felt dizzy.
Again.
I saw myself lying on Qin Zidian's body, and before I knew it, she was shouting at me: "Qin Yifei, Qin Yifei! What's wrong with you?! Wake up!
When I woke up, I couldn't avoid the interrogations from both Qin Zidian and Cold Chen.
"Have you been to the hospital?" Qin Zidian clenched her fists together and stared straight into my eyes.
I nodded: "Yes, the doctor said it was just a minor issue. I have some anemia."
I pointed at him with shaking hands:
He took out his phone and dialed a number. After a few seconds, he handed it to me: "It's your boyfriend, Rain Yifei. He wants to talk to you."Which hospital was it? Cold Channing asked.
Of course, it was XX Hospital, I panicked and my eyes darted back and forth, unable to meet the two of them' faces.
"Oh?" Cold Channing pulled out his phone, "I'll call around."
I desperately tried to stop him: "Don't... don't do that, I'm fine."
Ruan Heng suddenly laughed twice: "Qin Yuwei, you're not very good at lying. I taught you, when lying, your expression shouldn't change, the main point is to make up a lie smoothly."
I was taken aback and replied quickly: "Ruan Heng, you're so smart! I'm telling the truth, I've never been to the hospital."
I grabbed my bag and tried to leave, but Cold Channing held me back: "Yuwei, are you not actually sick?"
"I don't know, I'll go to the hospital to check.",
Cold Channing and Ruan Heng looked at each other in confusion. Suddenly his eyes widened and he shook with fear: "Was it like last time?"
"Last time? What were you talking about?",
He froze for a moment like a popped balloon: "Look at your face, I must have guessed right."
I didn't think of anything to say so he started the car: "Let's go see Zhao Lin Hao now."
I tried to block him again: "Don't! Cold Channing, please don't tell him..."
"Qin Yuwei...", Ruan Heng's eyes sparkled.
"Do you two want to face a difficult situation?",
I shook my head crying: "I don't know how long I can stay here, I don't want to make things harder for both of you. Just thinking about it now makes me so sad. When he said he loved me last time, his expression is still haunted in my mind, I don't know what to say."
"If you just say 'Zhao Lin Hao, I love you'... won't that be a bit drastic?",
Ruan Heng was furious: "You're almost leaving now, if you don't say it now, there won't be another chance!"
She told Cold Channing to go find a megaphone.
I stood in front of the Hong Hao Group building holding a megaphone, feeling helpless.
"Hey!",
Ruan Heng was impatient: "Come on."
"Coffee?",
"Don't be ridiculous, Ruan Heng! Wait for me to do some psychological preparations.",
"Why are you being so slow?",
I had the courage now and pressed the button without hesitation. Suddenly a loud voice came from the megaphone:
"Recycling old mobile phones, old TVs, old furniture, old computers, notebooks..."
I: "...".
"Cold Channing, what kind of broken megaphone is this!",
Ruan Heng was shocked to the point her face turned blue.
"I borrowed it from a recycling company owner because I had to get it fast...", Cold Channing said sheepishly.===== CONTENT TO TRANSLATE =====
Those loud voices calling out for trash collection made passersby stop and stare, with some even stopping to watch.
My face was slightly flushed.
"喊!" Ramue reminded me again.
I took a deep breath, pressed the shout button, and let out a loud voice: "赵霆皓, I love you! Zhao gláo hǎo, I love you!……"
My confession of love to our boss drew a crowd, with office employees rushing over as well.
Ramue's friend Li Cold looked on in shock, while Ramue herself exclaimed: "赵霆皓, Rain Vie says she loves you!"
Before long, I saw our boss's face light up and hurry out of the room.
I lowered the mic and straightened my back to face him: "Boss."
He walked over slowly, his movements calm. "Rain Vie, what did you just say?"
I threw my arms around his waist: "Boss, I said I love you!"
He was overcome with joy, holding me tight and whispering my name repeatedly.
The crowd of onlookers applauded wildly, blowing their whistles and even crying tears of joy.
I buried my head in his chest, feeling happy as if I was dreaming.
Maybe this is just a dream?
Because I feel like I'm about to wake up now….

Fifteen, Do you still love me after all this?
"Author, long time no see," the voice said from the darkness. "I'm not sure what's going on, but my account suddenly logged in again and won't log out. We've finally gotten to switch back, but I'll miss you so much." Ramue sobbed uncontrollably.
"I'm sorry, Author," she continued. "Because I didn't expect things to turn out like this, so..."
"What do you mean?" I choked on my words.
"I got married to Zhou Yang and... "
Her voice trailed off.
The conversation was cut short after only a few sentences.
This time the transition was shorter than usual, and before I knew it, the conversation had ended. 
I opened my eyes and saw an unfamiliar room. I sat up in bed.
"Rain Vie……"
I turned my head to see Zhou Yang's drawn face.He suddenly burst into tears: "My rain flower has left, right?"
I also felt a pang of pain to an unbearable degree, my right hand was unable to contain its own heart, but something had squeezed down on my arm.
I looked down and found that I was actually carrying around a large belly."
I panicked and pointed at my belly and asked Zhou Yang: "Old brother, what's going on with this? Did you do it?"
「We got married, she's pregnant。」
So this should be their honeymoon suite).
Suddenly my phone rang and I picked it up, and saw that there was an incoming call from Mom.
I felt a surge of emotion in my eyes and answered the phone, and heard her gentle voice: "Daughter, when are you and Yang going to come over this weekend? Dad and I have already bought all the food."
「Mom...」My voice cracked with tears."
「Daughter, what's wrong? Who was messing with you? Tell me, tell Yang too, let him go clean up after you!*)
「It's just that there are some mixed emotions after getting pregnant."""
「Oh no, my little thing, I'm so sorry. You're so attached to both your husband and dad! How long will it take for you to grow up?!……Uh oh, I've messed up!*
There was a pause and then she started to giggle.
```
Okay, okay, not to mention it anymore, wait until Dad gets back soon."""
The phone call ended with a series of beeps.
I opened my novel website and saw that the author's account had automatically logged in and the screen displayed: "Repairing."
What is being repaired?
I crossed out those words, but they kept popping up again after a few seconds.
Maybe the site is on maintenance?
I didn't think of anything to do so I put my phone down for now. When I thought of Zhao Zhe's face, with his deep sadness on it, suddenly a wave of emotion washed over me.
「What's going on?」Zhou Yang looked at my phone in surprise.
I quickly looked again and saw the words "Repairing" slowly fading away, followed by "Story correction"*
I finally realized, I was interrupting the story. If I hadn't appeared, Rain Flower would have been changed back to her original form!
A while later, a scene popped up on my screen:
Me confessing my feelings to the CEO's video went viral online. The video ended with me fainting in his arms, he looked shocked and surprised.
Cutting off wifi for free: who is this? Is she my girlfriend?!?! She was so happy that she fainted!
I want a home: What the heck, she had met me recently! I even started to like her. 
Rank of cuteness queue was already full with over 1000 entries: Friend zone?! Where?! Dreams?!
The little emperor daughter: Everyone stop guessing, this is our CEO's wife.

盘子舔出火星子 回复 @弘皓小宝贝儿一枚：原来长这样啊？我突然觉得我也可以嫁入豪门啦！
我：「……”
赵霆皓坐在办公室里和秘书姐姐交谈。
秘：总裁，王歆池怎么处置？
赵（眼神阴鸷）：老样子。
我不禁提心吊胆，霸总你要对王歆池干什么？
秘：好的，总裁。
赵：等等，算了，放过她吧。雨薇知道的话肯定会生气的，她不喜欢……
看着这句话，我忍不住泪流满面。
这段时间我都守着手机，生怕错过有赵霆皓的场景。
怀孕真的很辛苦，常常不知不觉就饿了，而且饿得身体发虚直冒汗。
我现在就是。（“邹洋，邹洋！”）
没人应。
忘了，他刚才说自己出去买菜。
我打开冰箱，一眼就看见一盘麻辣小龙虾……
我的泪水又模糊了视线，不自觉喃喃道：「霸总，我想吃小龙虾，你这次还来帮我剥吗？」
回应我的是一片安静。
我抬手擦干眼泪，没有再看一眼麻辣小龙虾的勇气，把放它旁边的白斩鸡端了出来。将鸡简单热了热，香味瞬间弥漫四溢。
正当我大快朵颐时，邹洋来电话了：「雨薇，你把待会儿要带去丈母娘家的白斩鸡打包好。」我吓得一激灵，犹豫了会儿，说：「曾经的白斩鸡已经死了，现在只有口水鸡…」
邹洋：「……”
好久没见过爸爸妈妈，当再次见到时我的眼眶又开始热热的了。
作为一名孕妇，最开心的事就是大家都会让着我。
除了妈妈。
「妈，这个菜好像有点儿咸。」
「…咸就吃别的。」
我扒拉了会儿饭，又舀了碗汤。
「妈，这个汤是不是火候不够呀？不是很浓郁呢！」
「……”「妈……」
「Rain, eat fish, okay?」 mom interrupted my talk, "You're always poking around for trouble, what are you doing?"
Me：「……」
I wrapped her arms around me and said, «mom……」
「All the people who are supposed to be like parents now, how can you act like a kid anyway?」 mom gently patted on my back, "Eat your food, don't make yourself and the baby hangry.”
I secretly wiped away tears, picked up a fish head with chopsticks, but only managed to pick it up with both my chopsticks and yours at the same time.
You let go, and re-picked up another piece of fish.
「Why did I give you fish head when I know Rain doesn't like it?」 mom said.
「Give it to Rain.」 he didn't seem to care much, it was probably an habit now."
「What should I do? There are so many people on the bus who would let her sit down first.”
Me：「……」
Waaaahhh, mom's words made me not dare to eat fish head myself anymore, why does she think mom likes son-in-law more?
I pouted my mouth, feeling pitifully looking at dad, «dad……」
Dad chuckled and said, "I was worried that Rain and you wouldn't get along when I first thought of marrying you, now I'm relieved. “
I stomped my foot in frustration, not this again, the issue is the fish head, I want to eat it.
I suddenly grabbed dad's arm, «look……」
Mom and dad were surprised.
I paused for a moment, and then tears fell from my eyes again."
Dad softly said, «don't cry, don't cry or you'll catch a cold.”
I thought, if I wasn't carrying a big belly like Rain, he would be so soft on me too.
Here is the translated content in English:
After eating dinner, I went back home and opened my phone again, still at "Plot correction in progress...".
As I was about to put the phone down, the screen suddenly popped up with an error message: Plot correction failed. Reason detection in progress….
I held my breath, staring at the screen fixedly, focusing on Rain's face."
She cried and her eyes were red from crying, scene showed her voice: "Waaahhh... I want to go back! I miss dad and mom and husband……".
Seeing her cry, I also started to sob.
You handed me a paper towel to wipe my tears away.
However, my tear ducts just wouldn't stop flowing).
You softly whispered to me, «don't cry, don't cry or you'll catch a cold.”
I thought, if only I didn't have this big belly like Rain, he would be even softer on me too.「I just can't help myself!」I blew my nose, „How can you make me restrain myself?"""
He was silent for a moment and then said：「You cry so much that your eyes are swollen, I thought at first glance that you looked like a melancholic frog …"
I：「……"
The screen continued to show the scene unfolding.
Cold Mountain came running in, carrying a bucket. He excitedly placed the bucket in front of Rainy Veil.
Cold Mountain:Rainy Veil, look (opening the bucket) open, open, open! I remember you used to love chocolate beans back when you were younger!
RQIN: Thanks, Cold Mountain.
Cold Mountain:Don't thank me, it's actually those chocolate beans that I picked up yesterday while going hiking in the countryside.
RQIN:How many did you pick?
Cold Mountain:Yes, there are quite a lot. Luckily, my reflexes are quick, or all of them would have been snatched away by sheep!
RQIN (with a black line on his face):You picked those up? They're probably just sheep crap …
Cold Mountain:……
RQIN:Actually, Cold Mountain, you shouldn't be being so good to me. You'd forget about me anyway. I've gotten married and have a kid already.
Scene ended, and the camera cut back to Cold Mountain sitting alone on the couch.
Heart voice:Tell the truth, I often feel confused. Sometimes I even think any of them would do. Maybe it's because there are only your face printed in my brain for twenty years or more. You're back, and yet you have other men around me. It can't be mine, so I decide to let go (looking up at the sky). Friends, do you know if you can see me now? Do you support my decision?
I cried with tears, „Support。」
「Can you see anything? Tell me what you saw.」Zuo Yang was beside me, saying.
I wanted to tell him about the previous scene, but suddenly my phone screen popped up with a line of text: Detected complete (reason: Male protagonist 1 number).
My heart and Zuo Yang's froze in shock.
Is it Qian Xun?
No more than a minute later, the scene switched to Zhao Lingbo. He was tightly hugging me with the scarf I knitted him and those pants he loves, weeping uncontrollably.
Heart voice:Rainy Veil, I miss you so much! If I destroyed this story, wouldn't you come back?
 „No way!„I shouted even though I knew he couldn't hear me.
If I destroy this story, would that world even exist anymore!?
The screen continued to change:Clearing target: Male protagonist 1 number. Clearing in progress....
Is this about deleting him?
Luckily, the clearing was failed (reason: not within the clearance range).
I breathed a sigh of relief, my heart still racing from the previous moment.
「No way!„I cried out again, almost fainting from fear.
But fortunately, it failed to clear.After another "Story Adjusting" screen appeared, followed by "Clear Failure".
This process was constantly repeating, never leaving a countdown scene like before.
So, didn't I have any other way out?  Actually, it wasn't possible to go back anyway. Since I was there with my parents, but why did my tears still keep flowing?
Zhao Lianhao, I also long for you.
That world was snowing again, the flakes falling gently and swiftly, covering the entire city in a thick layer of white, until it became as if the whole town had been blanketed by an endless sea of snow. The wind blew, sending the snow swirling everywhere, like the scene from that time.
I saw Zhao Lianhao sitting on the green belt outside his door again, wrapped up in his coat to keep a turtle pond warm and tightly embracing it, then just staring at me as I walked back through the route I had taken previously.
The snow fell heavily, so soon he became a statue of white in an instant.
My throat felt like someone was stabbing me, my heart torn apart as if something was frantically tearing at my chest, unable to breathe.
His lips were blue and frostbitten, his expression bleak, whispering weakly, "Rainy, I'm over here with the little turtle. Are you still going to come back like last time? Will you?"
I couldn't hold it in anymore and burst into uncontrollable sobs: "Lianhao...Zhao Lianhao!"
Just as I was crying my heart out, Mom appeared.
She heard me sobbing and rushed straight to my room. She swept me up in a tight hug and asked, "Rainy, what's wrong? Tell me!"
"I want him so much..."
"Is it Zhao Lianhao?"
I hesitated for a moment, with tears blurring my vision: "How did you know?"
"My sister Ouyang told me." She stroked my hair gently. "Actually, I realized early on that you're special. Sometimes you'd be lively and other times quiet and reserved. You're my daughter, how could I not notice? That girl is very nice indeed. Mom loved her so much! She was like another daughter to us."
I was taken aback: "Mom..."
"I hope you'll be brave enough." Mom smiled warmly. "I'm happy that you exist, Rainy. And happy for the other Rainy who's a good girl too. Life is short, and not many people get to meet someone they truly love. I don't want you to miss out on him."
I buried my face in her shoulder.
After Mom left, I thought about calling Ouyang to help me cook dinner but saw him holding the engagement photo of Rainy and Zhao Lianhao, tears streaming down his face silently crying.
I closed the door without a sound, leaning against the wall feeling powerless."This isn't a different plot, is it?"
"Okay, go ahead, have fun."
About half a month later, I finally reached the end.
But when I clicked on the finish button, a message suddenly popped up: "There's already this background setting. Please select one to delete."
My heart sank instantly and I felt like I'd hit rock bottom. Was it really that bad?
Xu Yang went down to the hallway to light a few cigarettes after that, and when he came back, his eyes were red from crying, saying "Delete it."
I hesitated for a long time, looking at the screen displaying Zhao Tian Hua's sorrowful expression, and suddenly I made up my mind.
I pressed the delete key with shaking hands.
The scene froze on the screen for a few seconds before disappearing like smoke.
My phone rang, and my brother Lao Brother shouted at me "What's wrong with you? How could you delete the whole thing? Did you know how this would affect us?"
But I just hung up immediately. Full of confidence, I typed in the title: "The Tyrant Everyday Gets Beat Up By Me...".
I thought about writing a story that connected to the real world, maybe then I'd have a chance to travel between the two worlds.
The more I thought about it, the more I realized this plan was possible. But I couldn't shake off the fear of failure.
Oh well, let's take a gamble!
I told Xu Yang about my plan, and after a moment of silence, he decided to support me.
"Wow, Zhao Tian Hua really got beaten up badly," Xu Yang looked at the screen, though trying to act nonchalant, I could tell he was secretly happy.
“...It wasn't intentional,”
He fell silent for a while before saying, "You have to write to that point where you and Rainy Rose get together."
I nodded.
We followed the same routine we did before, but this time we were even more nervous, not daring to think about failure's consequences.
Finally a month went by, I wrote down my story from the beach, and with a trembling hand, clicked on the finish button.
Had I done it?
But in half a second, something unexpected happened...
Oh man, I forgot to give Cold Chan an OTP!
Oh no, oh no! Get back and revise, revise!
I have to do this again!
A wave of dizziness washed over me...
I suddenly opened my eyes to see the ceiling of Zhao Tian Hua's bedroom above me, and a water droplet-shaped lamp hanging from it.
I turned around to look at that face I had been daydreaming about all night.I succeeded.

My heart was racing wildly, like I was about to jump out of my skin at any second.
After calming down, I sat beside his bed and lit a cigarette, saying, "Don't be sad, I'll take care of you."
He pulled up the blanket and revealed his cold and stern face with sharp jawline, a faint smile on his lips, and raised an eyebrow. He chuckled mockingly, extending his long finger to tilt my chin upwards: "Women, do you want to get your attention this way? Hmm?"
It was him, it really was him! Here he was, alive and in front of me!
I almost burst into tears.
Now that I'm back for the second time, will you still love me?
Epilogue
I was lucky to have succeeded.

I can now freely travel between reality and fiction with Ganyu.

This is my second year back with Zhao Lin. Do you remember when he first came back? He was extremely cold and arrogant at that time. But after spending more time with me, his feelings towards me started to change, and now he's almost become a loyal dog boyfriend.
After being together, I told him about my true identity, and he listened skeptically, half-believing it and also using reason and science to doubt its existence. He asked me if I was just pretending to be someone else. 
But after going back and forth with Ganyu a few times, the facts became clear to him, and finally, he believed it.
He felt sorry that he would never get to see my parents again. So whenever I return home, he always asks me to give them some messages, sometimes wishing well, sometimes promising good things about me.
As for Jie Yan and Ganyu, Jie Yan has worked hard to win her back, and eventually, they became a happy family with a adorable baby boy last year.

Ganyu held my hand and said, "Thank you, author. You helped me find my happiness." 
Not long after that, I got pregnant too. Zhao Lin was over the moon with excitement, bragging about being a soon-to-be dad every day at work, even getting on hot searches for it.
The only thing he couldn't accept is Cold Chen, who seemed to be unfazed by me not having any "CP" (Chinese: , literally "personality crush"). He still had trouble settling down, and his bank account got frozen again. 
But one day, I happened to see him and Qin Zhongwen walking together in the street. He was following her around enthusiastically, matching her every step.
Everything was so warm and beautiful.
